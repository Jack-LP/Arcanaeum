    "text": "16 Accords of Madness, v. VI\nHircine's Tale\nEver proud and boastful, Oblivion's Mad Prince stood one fifth day of mid year among the frigid peaks of Skyrim, and beckoned forth Hircine for parlay. The Huntsman God materialized, for this was his day, and the boldness of Sheogorath intrigued him.\nWry without equal, Sheogorath holds in his realm giggling loons, flamboyant auteurs, and craven mutilators. The Mad Prince will ply profitless bargains and promote senseless bloodshed for nothing more than the joy of another's confusion, tragedy, or rage. So it was that Sheogorath had set a stage on which to play himself as rival to Hircine.\nWithout haste, the coy Prince proffered his contest; each Prince was to groom a beast to meet at this place again, three years to the hour, and do fatal battle. Expressionless behind his fearsome countenance, Hircine agreed, and with naught but a dusting of snow in the drift, the Princes were gone to their realms.\nConfident, but knowing Sheogorath for a trickster, Hircine secretly bred an abomination in his hidden realm. An ancient Daedroth he summoned, and imbued it with the foul curse of lycanthropy. Of pitch heart and jagged fang, the unspeakable horror had no peer, even among the great hunters of Hircine's sphere.\nIn the third year, on the given day, Hircine returned, where Sheogorath leaned, cross-legged on a stone, whistling with idle patience. The Prince of the Hunt struck his spear to the ground, bringing forth his unnatural, snarling behemoth. Doffing his cap, sly as ever, Sheogorath stood and stepped aside to reveal a tiny, colorful bird perched atop the stone. Demurely it chirped in the bristling gusts, scarcely audible.\nIn a twisted, springing heap, the Daedroth was upon the stone, leaving only rubble where the boulder had been. Thinking itself victorious, the monster's bloodied maw curled into a mock grin, when a subdued song drifted in the crisp air. The tiny bird lightly hopped along the snout of the furious Daedroth. Sheogorath looked on, quietly mirthful, as the diminutive creature picked at a bit of detritus caught in scales betwixt the fiery eyes of the larger beast. With howling fury, the were-thing blinded itself trying to pluck away the nuisance. And so it continued for hours, Hircine looking on in shame while his finest beast gradually destroyed itself in pursuit of the seemingly oblivious bird, all the while chirping a mournful tune to the lonesome range.\nLivid, but beaten, Hircine burned the ragged corpse and withdrew to his realm, swearing in forgotten tongues. His curses still hang in those peaks, and no wayfarer tarries for fear of his wrathful aspect in those obscured heights.\nTurning on his heel, Sheogorath beckoned the miniscule songbird to perch atop his shoulder, and strolled down the mountain, making for the warm breezes and vibrant sunsets of the Abecean coast, whistling in tune with the tiniest champion in Tamriel.\n16 Accords of Madness, v. IX\nVaermina's Tale\nDarius Shano found himself running as fast as he could.\nHe had no idea what he was running from or towards, but he didn't care. The desire saturated his mind -- there was nothing in the world except flight. He looked around for landmarks, anything to place himself or to use as a target, but to no avail -- the featureless grasslands through which he was sprinting extended as far as the eye could see. \"Just have to keep running\", he thought to himself. \"I have to run as fast as I can\". On and on he ran, with no end in sight or in mind....\nStanding over Darius Shano while he lay quietly in his bed were his mistress, Vaermina the Dreamweaver, and the Madgod Sheogorath. Vaernima looked down with pride at this disciple of hers, and was boastful of her little jewel.\n\"Such potential in this one! Through dreams of inspiration, I have nurtured literary talent into fruition, and now he stands in acclaim as an emerging bard and poet! He will gain much favor before I tire of him.\" Sheogorath, too, gazed at the young Breton artist and saw that he was indeed famous among the other mortals.\n\"Hmmm,\" mused Sheogorath, \"but how many are there who hate this mortal whom you have built? It is the hatred of the mortals which confirms greatness, and not their love. Surely you can accomplish this as well?\"\nVaernima's eyes narrowed. \"Yes, the mortals are indeed often foolish and petty, and it is true that many of their most bold have been despised. Do not worry, mad one, for I have the power to achieve many forms of greatness with this one, hatred among them.\"\n\"Perhaps, Dreamweaver, it would be amusing to show who has this power? Inspire foolish, arrogant hatred of this mortal for ten years, and then I will do the same. We shall see whose talents are most efficient, free of aid or interference from any of the Daedra.\"\nAt this, she relaxed into confident pleasure. \"The Madgod is indeed powerful, but this task is suited to my skills. The mortals are repulsed by madness, but rarely think it worthy of hate. I shall take pleasure in revealing this to you, as I bring the more subtle horrors out of this mortal's subconscious.\"\nAnd so, in the 19th year of his life, the dreams Darius Shano had been experiencing began to change. Fear had always been part of the night for him, but now there was something else. A darkness began to creep into his slumber, a darkness that sucked away all feeling and color, leaving only emptiness behind. When this happened, he opened his mouth to scream, but found that the darkness had taken his voice as well. All he had was the terror and the void, and each night they filled him with a new understanding of death. Yet, when he woke, there was no fear, for he had faith that his Lady had a purpose.\nIndeed, one night Vaernima herself emerged from the void. She leaned in close to whisper into his ear.\n\"Watch carefully, my beloved!\" With that, she pulled the void away, and for hours each night she would reveal to Darius the most horrible perversions of nature. Men being skinned and eaten alive by other men, unimaginable beasts of many limbs and mouths, entire populations being burned -- their screams filled his every evening. In time, these visions gnawed at his soul, and his work began to take on the character of his nightmares. The images revealed to him at night were reproduced on the page, and the terrible cruelty and hollow vice that his work contained both revolted and fascinated the public. They reveled in their disgust over every detail. There were those who openly enjoyed his shocking material, and his popularity among some only fed the hatred of those who found him abhorrent. This continued for several years, while the infamy of Darius grew steadily. Then, in his 29th year, without warning, the dreams and nightmares ceased.\nDarius felt a weight lifted, as he no longer endured the nightly tortures, but was confused. \"What have I done to displease my Mistress?\", he wondered aloud. \"Why has she abandoned me?\" Vaernima never answered his prayers. No one ever answered, and the restless dreams faded away to leave Darius in long, deep sleeps.\nInterest in the works of Darius Shano waned. His prose became stale and his ideas failed to provoke the shock and outrage they once had. As the memory of his notoriety and of his terrible dreams faded, the questions that raced in his mind eventually produced resentment against Vaernima, his former mistress. Resentment grew into hatred, from hatred came ridicule, and over time ridicule became disbelief. Slowly it became obvious -- Vaernima had never spoken to him at all; his dreams were simply the product of a sick mind that had righted itself. He had been deceived by his own subconscious, and the anger and shame overwhelmed him. The man who once conversed with a deity drifted steadily into heresy.\nIn time, all of the bitterness, doubt, and sacrilege focused in Darius a creative philosophy that was threaded throughout all of his subsequent work. He challenged the Gods themselves, as well as the infantile public and corrupt state for worshiping them. He mocked them all with perverse caricatures, sparing no one and giving no quarter. He challenged the Gods in public to strike him down if they existed, and ridiculed them when no such comeuppance was delivered. To all of this, the people reacted with outrage far greater than they had shown his previous work. His early career had offended only sensibilities, but now he was striking directly at the heart of the people.\nHis body of work grew in size and intensity. Temples, nobles, and commoners were all targets of his scorn. Finally, at age 39, Darius wrote a piece entitled \"The Noblest Fool,\" ridiculing The Emperor God Tiber Septim for integrating into the pathetic Nine Divines cult. The local King of Daenia, who had been humiliated by this upstart in the past, saw his chance -- for his sacrilege against the Empire, Darius Shano was executed, with a ceremonial blade, in front of a cheering crowd of hundreds. His last, bitter words were gurgled through a mouthful of his own blood.\n20 years after their wager was first placed, Vaernima and Sheogorath met over Darius Shano's headless corpse. The Dreamweaver had been eager for this meeting; she had been waiting for years to confront the Daedric Prince over his lack of action.\n\"I have been deceived by you, Sheogorath! I performed my half of the bargain, but during your ten years you never contacted the mortal once. He owes none of his greatness to you or your talents or your influence!\"\n\"Nonsense,\" croaked the Madgod. \"I was with him all along! When your time ended and mine began, your whispers in his ear were replaced with silence. I severed his link to that from which he found the most comfort and meaning, and withheld the very attention the creature so desperately craved. Without his mistress, this man's character could ripen under resentment and hatred. Now his bitterness is total and, overcome by a madness fueled by his rage, he feeds me in my realm as an eternal servant.\"\nSheogorath turned and spoke to the empty space by his side.\n\"Indeed; Darius Shano was a glorious mortal. Despised by his own people, his kings, and even by the Gods he mocked. For my success, I shall accept three-score followers of Vaernima into my service. And the dreamers will awaken as madmen.\"\nAnd thus did Sheogorath teach Vaernima that without madness, there are no dreams, and no creation. Vaernima will never forget this lesson.\n16 Accords of Madness, v. XII\nMalacath's Tale\nIn the days before the Orsinium's founding, the spurned Orc-folk were subjected to ostracism and persecutions even more numerous and harsh than their progeny are accustomed to in our own age. So it was that many champions of the Orsimer traveled, enforcing what borders they could for the proliferation of their own people. Many of these champions are spoken of yet today, among them the Cursed Legion, Gromma the Hairless, and the noble Emmeg Gro-Kayra. This latter crusader would have certainly risen to legendary status throughout Tamriel, had he not been subject to the attention of certain Daedric Princes.\nEmmeg Gro-Kayra was the bastard son of a young maiden who was killed in childbirth. He was raised by the shaman of his tribe, the Grilikamaug in the peaks of what we now call Normar Heights. Late in his fifteenth year, Emmeg forged by hand an ornate suit of scaled armor, a rite of ascension among his tribe. On a blustery day, he pounded the final rivet, and draping a heavy cloak over the bulky mantle, Emmeg set out from his village for the last time. Word of his exploits always returned home, whether defending merchant caravans from brigands or liberating enslaved beast folk. News of the noble Orc crusader began to grace even the lips of Bretons, often with a tinge of fear.\nLess than two years after ascending to maturity, Gro-Kayra was making camp when a thin voice called out from the thickening night. He was surprised to hear the language of his people spoken by a tongue that obviously did not belong to an Orc.\n'Lord Kayra', said the voice, 'tales of your deeds have crossed the lips of many, and have reached my ears.' Peering into the murk, Emmeg made out the silhouette of a cloaked figure, made wavy and ephemeral by the hazy campfire. From the voice alone he had thought the interloper an old hag, but he now decided that he was in the presence of a man of slight and lanky build, though he could discern no further detail.\n'Perhaps,' the wary Orc began, 'but I seek no glory. Who are you?'\nIgnoring the question, the stranger continued, 'Despite that, Orsimer, glory finds you, and I bear a gift worthy of it.' The visitor's cloak parted slightly, revealing nothing but faintly glinting buttons in the pale moonlight, and a bundle was withdrawn and tossed to the side of the fire between the two. Emmeg cautiously removed the rags in which the object was swathed, and was dazzled to discover the item to be a wide, curved blade with ornately decorated handle. The weapon had heft, and Emmeg realized on brandishing it that the elaborate pommel disguised the more practical purpose of balancing the considerable weight of the blade itself. It was nothing much to look at in its present condition, thought the Orc, but once the tarnish was cleaned away and a few missing jewels restored, it would indeed be a blade worthy of a champion ten times his own worth.\n'Her name is Neb-Crescen' spoke the thin stranger, seeing the appreciation lighting Gro-Kayra's face. 'I got her for a horse and a secret in warmer climes, but in my old age I'd be lucky to even lift such a weapon. It's only proper that I pass her on to one such as yourself. To possess her is to change your life, forever.' Overcoming his initial infatuation with the arc of honed steel, Emmeg turned his attention back to the visitor.\n'Your words are fine, old man,' Emmeg said, not masking his suspicion, 'but I'm no fool. You traded for this blade once, and you'll trade for it again tonight. What is it that you want?' The stranger's shoulders slumped, and Emmeg was glad to have unveiled the true purpose of this twilight visit. He sat with him a while, eventually offering a stack of furs, warm food, and a handful of coins in exchange for the exotic weapon. By morning, the stranger was gone.\nIn the week following Emmeg's encounter with the stranger, Neb-Crescen had not left its scabbard. He had encountered no enemy in the woods, and his meals consisted of fowl and small game caught with bow and arrow. The peace suited him fine, but on the seventh morning, while fog still crept between the low-hanging boughs, Emmeg's ears pricked up at the telltale crunch of a nearby footfall in the dense snow and forest debris.\nEmmeg's nostrils flared, but he was upwind. Being unable to see or smell his guest, and knowing that the breeze carried his scent in that direction, Emmeg's guard was up, and he cautiously drew Neb-Crescen from its sheath. Emmeg himself was not entirely sure of all that happened next.\nThe first moment of conscious memory in Emmeg Gro-Kayra's mind after drawing Neb-Crescen was the image of the curved blade sweeping through the air in front of him, spattering blood over the virginal powder coating the forest floor. The second memory was a feeling of frenzied bloodlust creeping over him, but it was then that he saw for the first time his victim, an Orc woman perhaps a few years younger than himself, her body a canvas of grisly wounds, enough to kill a strong man ten times over.\nEmmeg's disgust overwhelmed the madness that had overtaken him, and with all his will enlisted, he released Neb-Crescen from his grip and let the blade sail. With a discordant ringing it spun through the air and was buried in a snowdrift. Emmeg fled the scene in shame and horror, drawing the hood of his cloak up to hide himself from the judging eyes of the rising sun.\nThe scene where Emmeg Gro-Kayra had murdered one of his own kind was a macabre one. Below the neck, the body was flayed and mutilated almost beyond recognition, but the untouched face was frozen in a permanent expression of abject terror.\nIt was here that Sheogorath performed certain rites that summoned Malacath, and the two Daedric Lords held court in the presence of the disfigured corpse.\n'Why show me this, Mad One?' began Malacath, once he recovered from his initial, wordless outrage. 'Do you take such pleasure in watching me grieve the murder of my children?' His guttural voice rumbled, and the patron of the Orismer looked upon his counterpart with accusing eyes.\n'By birth, she was yours, brother outcast,' began Sheogorath, solemn in aspect and demeanor. 'But she was a daughter of mine by her own habits. My mourning here is no less than your own, my outrage no less great.'\n'I am not so sure,' grumbled Malacath, 'but rest assured that vengeance for this crime is mine to reap. I expect no contest from you. Stand aside.' As the fearsome Prince began to push past him, Lord Sheogorath spoke again.\n'I have no intention of standing between you and vengeance. In fact, I mean to help you. I have servants in this wilderness, and can tell you just where to find our mutual foe. I ask only that you use a weapon of my choosing. Wound the criminal with my blade, and banish him to my plane, where I can exact my own punishment. The rights of honor-killing here belong to you.'\nWith that, Malacath agreed, took the wide blade from Sheogorath, and was gone.\nMalacath materialized in the path of the murderer, the cloaked figure obscured through a blizzard haze. Bellowing a curse so foul as to wilt the surrounding trees, the blade was drawn and Malacath crossed the distance more quickly than a wild fox. Frothing with rage, he swung the blade in a smooth arc which lopped the head of his foe cleanly off, then plunged the blade up to its hilt in his chest, choking off the spurts of blood into a steady, growing stain of red bubbling from beneath the scaled armor and heavy cloak.\nPanting from the unexpected immediacy and fury of his own kill, Malacath rested on a knee as the body before him collapsed heavily backwards and the head landed roughly upon a broad, flat stone. The next sound broke the silence like a bolt.\n'I - I'm sorry...' sputtered the voice of Emmeg Gro-Kayra. Malacath's eyes went wide as he looked upon the severed head, seeping blood from its wound, but somehow kept alive. Its eyes wavered about wildly, trying to focus on the aspect of Malacath before it. The once-proud eyes of the champion were choked with tears of grief, pain, and confused recognition.\nTo his horror, Malacath recognized only now that the man he had killed was not only one of his Orismer children, but very literally a son he had blessed an Orc maiden with years hence. For achingly long moments the two looked upon each other, despondent and shocked.\nThen, silent as oiled steel, Sheogorath strode into the clearing. He hefted Emmeg Gro-Kayra's disembodied head and bundled it into a small, grey sack. Sheogorath reclaimed Neb-Crescen from the corpse and turned to walk away. Malacath began to stand, but kneeled again, knowing he had irreversibly damned his own offspring to the realm of Sheogorath, and mourned his failure as the sound of his son's hoarse pleas faded into the frozen horizon."

    "text": "2920, Morning Star, Book 1\nMorning Star\nBook One of 2920\nThe Last Year of the First Era\nby\nCarlovac Townway\n\n1 Morning Star, 2920\nMournhold, Morrowind\nAlmalexia lay in her bed of fur, dreaming. Not until the sun burned through her window, infusing the light wood and flesh colors of her chamber in a milky glow did she open her eyes. It was quiet and serene, a stunning reverse of the flavor of her dreams, so full of blood and celebration. For a few moments, she simply stared at the ceiling, trying to sort through her visions.\nIn the courtyard of her palace was a boiling pool which steamed in the coolness of the winter morning. At the wave of her hand, it cleared and she saw the face and form of her lover Vivec in his study to the north. She did not want to speak right away: he looked so handsome in his dark red robes, writing his poetry as he did every morning.\n\"Vivec,\" she said, and he raised his head in a smile, looking at her face across thousands of miles. \"I have seen a vision of the end of the war.\"\n\"After eighty years, I don't think anyone can imagine an end,\" said Vivec with a smile, but he grew serious, trusting Almalexia's prophecies. \"Who will win? Morrowind or the Cyrodilic Empire?\"\n\"Without Sotha Sil in Morrowind, we will lose,\" she replied.\n\"My intelligence tells me the Empire will strike us to the north in early springtide, by First Seed at the latest. Could you go to Artaeum and convince him to return?\"\n\"I'll leave today,\" she said, simply.\n4 Morning Star, 2920\nGideon, Black Marsh\nThe Empress paced around her cell. Wintertide gave her wasteful energy, while in the summer she would merely sit by her window and be grateful for each breath of stale swamp wind that came to cool her. Across the room, her unfinished tapestry of a dance at the Imperial Court seemed to mock her. She ripped it from its frame, tearing the pieces apart as they drifted to the floor.\nThen she laughed at her own useless gesture of defiance. She would have plenty of time to repair it and craft a hundred more. The Emperor had locked her up in Castle Giovesse seven years ago, and would likely keep her here until he or she died.\nWith a sigh, she pulled the cord to call her knight, Zuuk. He appeared at the door within minutes, fully uniformed as befitted an Imperial Guard. Most of the native Kothringi tribesmen of Black Marsh preferred to go about naked, but Zuuk had taken a positive delight to fashion. His silver, reflective skin was scarcely visible, only on his face, neck, and hands.\n\"Your Imperial Highness,\" he said with a bow.\n\"Zuuk,\" said Empress Tavia. \"I'm bored. Lets discuss methods of assassinating my husband today.\"\n14 Morning Star, 2920\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil\nThe chimes proclaiming South Wind's Prayer echoed through the wide boulevards and gardens of the Imperial City, calling all to their temples. The Emperor Reman III always attended a service at the Temple of the One, while his son and heir Prince Juilek found it more political to attend a service at a different temple for each religious holiday. This year, it was at the cathedral Benevolence of Mara.\nThe Benevolence's services were mercifully short, but it was not until well after noon that the Emperor was able to return to the palace. By then, the arena combatants were impatiently waiting for the start of the ceremony. The crowd was far less restless, as the Potentate Versidue-Shaie had arranged for a demonstration from a troupe of Khajiiti acrobats.\n\"Your religion is so much more convenient than mine,\" said the Emperor to his Potentate by way of an apology. \"What is the first game?\"\n\"A one-on-one battle between two able warriors,\" said the Potentate, his scaly skin catching the sun as he rose. \"Armed befitting their culture.\"\n\"Sounds good,\" said the Emperor and clapped his hands. \"Let the sport commence!\"\nAs soon as he saw the two warriors enter the arena to the roar of the crowd, Emperor Reman III remembered that he had agreed to this several months before and forgotten about it. One combatant was the Potentate's son, Savirien-Chorak, a glistening ivory-yellow eel, gripping his katana and wakizashi with his thin, deceptively weak looking arms. The other was the Emperor's son, Prince Juilek, in ebony armor with a savage Orcish helm, shield and longsword at his side.\n\"This will be fascinating to watch,\" hissed the Potentate, a wide grin across his narrow face. \"I don't know if I've even seen a Cyrodiil fight an Akavir like this. Usually it's army against army. At last we can settle which philosophy is better -- to create armor to combat swords as your people do, or to create swords to combat armor as mine do.\"\nNo one in the crowd, aside from a few scattered Akaviri counselors and the Potentate himself wanted Savirien-Chorak to win, but there was a collective intake of breath at the sight of his graceful movements. His swords seemed to be a part of him, a tail coming from his arms to match the one behind him. It was a trick of counterbalance, allowing the young serpent man to roll up into a circle and spin into the center of the ring in offensive position. The Prince had to plod forward the less impressive traditional way.\nAs they sprang at each other, the crowd bellowed with delight. The Akaviri was like a moon in orbit around the Prince, effortlessly springing over his shoulder to attempt a blow from behind, but the Prince whirled around quickly to block with his shield. His counter-strike met only air as his foe fell flat to the ground and slithered between his legs, tripping him. The Prince fell to the ground with a resounding crash.\nMetal and air melted together as Savirien-Chorak rained strike after strike upon the Prince, who blocked every one with his shield.\n\"We don't have shields in our culture,\" murmured Versidue-Shaie to the Emperor. \"It seems strange to my boy, I imagine. In our country, if you don't want to get hit, you move out of the way.\"\nWhen Savirien-Chorak was rearing back to begin another series of blinding attacks, the Prince kicked at his tail, sending him falling back momentarily. In an instant, he had rebounded, but the Prince was also back on his feet. The two circled one another, until the snake man spun forward, katana extended. The Prince saw his foe's plan, and blocked the katana with his longsword and the wakizashi with his shield. Its short punching blade impaled itself in the metal, and Savirien-Chorak was thrown off balance.\nThe Prince's longblade slashed across the Akavir's chest and the sudden, intense pain caused him to drop both his weapons. It a moment, it was over. Savirien-Chorak was prostate in the dust with the Prince's longsword at his throat.\n\"The game's over!\" shouted the Emperor, barely heard over the applause from the stadium.\nThe Prince grinned and helped Savirien-Chorak up and over to a healer. The Emperor clapped his Potentate on the back, feeling relieved. He had not realized when the fight had begun how little chance he had given his son at victory.\n\"He will make a fine warrior,\" said Versidue-Shaie. \"And a great emperor.\"\n\"Just remember,\" laughed the Emperor. \"You Akaviri have a lot of showy moves, but if just one of our strikes comes through, it's all over for you.\"\n\"Oh, I'll remember that,\" nodded the Potentate.\nReman thought about that comment for the rest of the games, and had trouble fully enjoying himself. Could the Potentate be another enemy, just as the Empress had turned out to be? The matter would bear watching.\n21 Morning Star, 2920\nMournhold, Morrowind\n\"Why don't you wear that green gown I gave you?\" asked the Duke of Mournhold, watching the young maiden put on her clothes.\n\"It doesn't fit,\" smiled Turala. \"And you know I like red.\"\n\"It doesn't fit because you're getting fat,\" laughed the Duke, pulling her down on the bed, kissing her breasts and the pouch of her stomach. She laughed at the tickles, but pulled herself up, wrapping her red robe around her.\n\"I'm round like a woman should be,\" said Turala. \"Will I see you tomorrow?\"\n\"No,\" said the Duke. \"I must entertain Vivec tomorrow, and the next day the Duke of Ebonheart is coming. Do you know, I never really appreciated Almalexia and her political skills until she left?\"\n\"It is the same with me,\" smiled Turala. \"You will only appreciate me when I'm gone.\"\n\"That's not true at all,\" snorted the Duke. \"I appreciate you now.\"\nTurala allowed the Duke one last kiss before she was out the door. She kept thinking about what he said. Would he appreciate her more or less when he knew that she was getting fat because she was carrying his child? Would he appreciate her enough to marry her?\nThe Year Continues in Sun's Dawn\n2920, Sun's Dawn, Book 2\nSun's Dawn\nBook Two of 2920\n\tThe Last Year of the First Era\nby\n\tCarlovac Townway\n3 Sun's Dawn, 2920\n\tThe Isle of Artaeum, Summurset\nSotha Sil watched the initiates float one by one up to the oassom tree, taking a fruit or a flower from its high branches before dropping back to the ground with varying degrees of grace. He took a moment while nodding his head in approval to admire the day. The whitewashed statue of Syrabane, which the great mage was said to have posed for in ancient days, stood at the precipice of the cliff overlooking the bay. Pale purple proscato flowers waves to and fro in the gentle breeze. Beyond, ocean, and the misty border between Artaeum and the main island of Summurset.\n\"By and large, acceptable,\" he proclaimed as the last student dropped her fruit in his hand. With a wave of his hand, the fruit and flowers were back in the tree. With another wave, the students had formed into position in a semicircle around the sorcerer. He pulled a small fibrous ball, about a foot in diameter from his white robes.\n\"What is this?\"\nThe students understood this test. It asked them to cast a spell of identification on the mysterious object. Each initiate closed his or her eyes and imagined the ball in the realm of the universal Truth. Its energy had a unique resonance as all physical and spiritual matter does, a negative aspect, a duplicate version, relative paths, true meaning, a song in the cosmos, a texture in the fabric of space, a facet of being that has always existed and always will exist.\n\"A ball,\" said a young Nord named Welleg, which brought giggles from some of the younger initiates, but a frown from most, including Sotha Sil.\n\"If you must be stupid, at least be amusing,\" growled the sorcerer, and then looked at a young, dark-haired Altmer lass who looked confused. \"Lilatha, do you know?\"\n\"It's grom,\" said Lilatha, uncertainly. \"What the dreugh meff after they've k-k-kr-krevinasim.\"\n\"Karvinasim, but very good, nonetheless,\" said Sotha Sil. \"Now, tell me, what does that mean?\"\n\"I don't know,\" admitted Lilatha. The rest of the students also shook their heads.\n\"There are layers to understanding all things,\" said Sotha Sil. \"The common man looks at an object and fits it into a place in his way of thinking. Those skilled in the Old Ways, in the way of the Psijic, in Mysticism, can see an object and identify it by its proper role. But one more layer is needed to be peeled back to achieve understanding. You must identify the object by its role and its truth and interpret that meaning. In this case, this ball is indeed grom, which is a substance created by the dreugh, an underwater race in the north and western parts of the continent. For one year of their life, they undergo karvinasim when they walk upon the land. Following that, they return to the water and meff, or devour the skin and organs they needed for land-dwelling. Then they vomit it up into little balls like this. Grom. Dreugh vomit.\"\nThe students looked at the ball a little queasily. Sotha Sil always loved this lesson.\n4 Sun's Dawn, 2920\n\tThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil\n\"Spies,\" muttered the Emperor, sitting in his bath, staring at a lump on his foot. \"All around me, traitors and spies.\"\nHis mistress Rijja washed his back, her legs wrapped around his waist. She knew after all these many years when to be sensual and when to be sexual. When he was in a mood like this, it was best to be calmly, soothingly, seductively sensual. And not to say a word unless he asked her a direct question.\nWhich he did: \"What do you think when a fellow steps on his Imperial Majesty's foot and says 'I'm sorry, Your Imperial Majesty'? Don't you think 'Pardon me, Your Imperial Majesty' is more appropriate? 'I'm sorry,' well that almost sounds like the bastard Argonian was sorry I am his Imperial Majesty. That he hopes we lose the war with Morrowind, that's what it sounds like.\"\n\"What would make you feel better?\" asked Rijja. \"Would you like him flogged? He is only, as you say, the Battlechief of Soulrest. It would teach him to mind where he's stepping.\"\n\"My father would have flogged him. My grandfather would have had him killed,\" the Emperor grumbled. \"But I don't mind if they all step on my feet, provided they respect me. And don't plot against me.\"\n\"You must trust someone.\"\n\"Only you,\" smiled the Emperor, turning slightly to give Rijja a kiss. \"And my son Juilek, I suppose, though I wish he were a little more cautious.\"\n\"And your council, and the Potentate?\" asked Rijja.\n\"A pack of spies and a snake,\" laughed the Emperor, kissing his mistress again. As they began to make love, he whispered, \"As long as you're true, I can handle the world.\"\n13 Sun's Dawn, 2920\n\tMournhold, Morrowind\nTurala stood at the black, bejeweled city gates. A wind howled around her, but she felt nothing.\nThe Duke had been furious upon hearing his favorite mistress was pregnant and cast her from his sight. She tried again and again to see him, but his guards turned her away. Finally, she returned to her family and told them the truth. If only she had lied and told them she did not know who the father was. A soldier, a wandering adventurer, anyone. But she told them that the father was the Duke, a member of the House Indoril. And they did what she knew they would have to do, as proud members of the House Redoran.\nUpon her hand was burned the sign of Expulsion her weeping father had branded on her. But the Duke's cruelty hurt her far more. She looked out the gate and into the wide winter plains. Twisted, sleeping trees and skies without birds. No one in Morrowind would take her in now. She must go far away.\nWith slow, sad steps, she began her journey.\n16 Sun's Dawn, 2920\n\tSenchal, Anequina (modern day Elsweyr)\n\"What troubles you?\" asked Queen Hasaama, noticing her husband's sour mood. At the end of most Lovers' Days he was in an excellent mood, dancing in the ballroom with all the guests, but tonight he retired early. When she found him, he was curled in the bed, frowning.\n\"That blasted bard's tale about Polydor and Eloisa put me in a rotten state,\" he growled. \"Why did he have to be so depressing?\"\n\"But isn't that the truth of the tale, my dear? Weren't they doomed because of the cruel nature of the world?\"\n\"It doesn't matter what the truth is, he did a rotten job of telling a rotten tale, and I'm not going to let him do it anymore,\" King Dro'Zel sprang from the bed. His eyes were rheumy with tears. \"Where did they say he was from again?\"\n\"I believe Gilverdale in easternmost Valenwood,\" said the Queen, shaken. \"My husband, what are you going to do?\"\nDro'Zel was out of the room in a single spring, bounding up the stairs to his tower. If Queen Hasaama knew what her husband was going to do, she did not try to stop him. He had been erratic of late, prone to fits and even occasional seizures. But she never suspected the depths of his madness, and his loathing for the bard and his tale of the wickedness and perversity found in mortal man.\n19 Sun's Dawn, 2920\n\tGilverdale, Valenwood\n\"Listen to me again,\" said the old carpenter. \"If cell three holds worthless brass, then cell two holds the gold key. If cell one holds the gold key, then cell three hold worthless brass. If cell two holds worthless brass, then cell one holds the gold key.\"\n\"I understand,\" said the lady. \"You told me. And so cell one holds the gold key, right?\"\n\"No,\" said the carpenter. \"Let me start from the top.\"\n\"Mama?\" said the little boy, pulling on his mother's sleeve.\n\"Just one moment, dear, mother's talking,\" she said, concentrating on the riddle. \"You said 'cell three holds the golden key if cell two holds worthless brass,' right?\"\n\"No,\" said the carpenter patiently. \"Cell three holds worthless brass, if cell two --\"\n\"Mama!\" cried the boy. His mother finally looked.\nA bright red mist was pouring over the town in a wave, engulfing building after building in its wake. Striding before was a red-skinned giant. The Daedra Molag Bal. He was smiling.\n29 Sun's Dawn, 2920\n\tGilverdale, Valenwood\nAlmalexia stopped her steed in the vast moor of mud to let him drink from the river. He refused to, even seemed repelled by the water. It struck her as odd: they had been making excellent time from Mournhold, and surely he must be thirsty. She dismounted and joined her retinue.\n\"Where are we now?\" she asked.\nOne of her ladies pulled out a map. \"I thought we were approaching a town called Gilverdale.\"\nAlmalexia closed her eyes and opened them again quickly. The vision was too much to bear. As her followers watched, she picked up a piece of brick and a fragment of bone, and clutched them to her heart.\n\"We must continue on to Artaeum,\" she said quietly.\nThe Year continues in First Seed.\n2920, First Seed, Book 3\nFirst Seed\nBook Three of 2920\nThe Last Year of the First Era\nby\nCarlovac Townway\n\n15 First Seed, 2920\nCaer Suvio, Cyrodiil\nFrom their vantage point high in the hills, the Emperor Reman III could still see the spires of the Imperial City, but he knew he was far away from hearth and home.  Lord Glavius had a luxurious villa, but it was not close to being large enough to house the entire army within its walls.  Tents lined the hillsides, and the soldiers were flocking to enjoy his lordship's famous hot springs.  Little wonder: winter chill still hung in the air.\n\"Prince Juilek, your son, is not feeling well.\"\nWhen Potentate Versidue-Shaie spoke, the Emperor jumped.  How that Akavir could slither across the grass without making a sound was a mystery to him.\n\"Poisoned, I'd wager,\" grumbled Reman. \"See to it he gets a healer.  I told him to hire a taster like I have, but the boy's headstrong.  There are spies all around us, I know it.\"\n\"I believe you're right, your imperial majesty,\" said Versidue-Shaie. \"These are treacherous times, and we must take precautions to see that Morrowind does not win this war, either on the field or by more insidious means.  That is why I would suggest that you not lead the vanguard into battle.  I know you would want to, as your illustrious ancestors Reman I, Brazollus Dor, and Reman II did, but I fear it would be foolhardy.  I hope you do not mind me speaking frankly like this.\"\n\"No,\" nodded Reman. \"I think you're right.  Who would lead the vanguard then?\"\n\"I would say Prince Juilek, if he were feeling better,\" replied the Akavir. \"Failing that, Storig of Farrun, with Queen Naghea of Riverhold at left flank, and Warchief Ulaqth of Lilmoth at right flank.\"\n\"A Khajiit at left flank and an Argonian at right,\" frowned the Emperor. \"I never do trust beastfolk.\"\nThe Potentate took no offense.  He knew that \"beastfolk\" referred to the natives of Tamriel, not to the Tsaesci of Akavir like himself. \"I quite agree your imperial majesty, but you must agree that they hate the Dunmer.  Ulaqth has a particular grudge after all the slave-raids on his lands by the Duke of Mournhold.\"\nThe Emperor conceded it was so, and the Potentate retired.  It was surprising, thought Reman, but for the first time, the Potentate seemed trustworthy.  He was a good man to have on one's side.\n18 First Seed, 2920\nAld Erfoud, Morrowind\n\"How far is the Imperial Army?\" asked Vivec.\n\"Two days' march,\" replied his lieutenant. \"If we march all night tonight, we can get higher ground at the Pryai tomorrow morning.  Our intelligence tells us the Emperor will be commanding the rear, Storig of Farrun has the vanguard, Naghea of Riverhold at left flank, and Ulaqth of Lilmoth at right flank.\"\n\"Ulaqth,\" whispered Vivec, an idea forming. \"Is this intelligence reliable?  Who brought it to us?\"\n\"A Breton spy in the Imperial Army,\" said the lieutenant and gestured towards a young, sandy-haired man who stepped forward and bowed to Vivec.\n\"What is your name and why is a Breton working for us against the Cyrodiils?\" asked Vivec, smiling.\n\"My name is Cassyr Whitley of Dwynnen,\" said the man. \"And I am working for you because not everyone can say he spied for a god.  And I understood it would be, well, profitable.\"\nVivec laughed, \"It will be, if your information is accurate.\"\n19 First Seed, 2920\nBodrums, Morrowind\nThe quiet hamlet of Bodrum looked down on the meandering river, the Pryai.  It was an idyllic site, lightly wooded where the water took the bend around a steep bluff to the east with a gorgeous wildflower meadow to the west.  The strange flora of Morrowind met the strange flora of Cyrodiil on the border and commingled gloriously.\n\"There will be time to sleep when you've finished!\"\nThe soldiers had been hearing that all morning.  It was not enough that they had been marching all night, now they were chopping down trees on the bluff and damming the river so its waters spilled over.  Most of them had reached the point where they were too tired to complain about being tired.\n\"Let me be certain I understand, my lord,\" said Vivec's lieutenant. \"We take the bluff so we can fire arrows and spells down on them from above.  That's why we need all the trees cleared out.  Damming the river floods the plain below so they'll be trudging through mud, which should hamper their movement.\"\n\"That's exactly half of it,\" said Vivec approvingly. He grabbed a nearby soldier who was hauling off the trees. \"Wait, I need you to break off the straightest, strongest branches of the trees and whittle them into spears.  If you recruit a hundred or so others, it won't take you more than a few hours to make all we need.\"\nThe soldier wearily did as he was bade.  The men and women got to work, fashioning spears from the trees.\n\"If you don't mind me asking,\" said the lieutenant. \"The soldiers don't need any more weapons.  They're too tired to hold the ones they've got.\"\n\"These spears aren't for holding,\" said Vivec and whispered, \"If we tired them out today, they'll get a good night's sleep tonight,\" before he got to work supervising their work.\nIt was essential that they be sharp, of course, but equally important that they be well balanced and tapered proportionally.  The perfect point for stability was a pyramid, not the conical point of some lances and spears.  He had the men hurl the spears they had completed to test their strength, sharpness, and balance, forcing them to begin on a new one if they broke.  Gradually, out of sheer exhaustion from doing it wrong, the men learned how to create the perfect wooden spears.  Once they were through, he showed them how they were to be arranged and where.\nThat night, there was no drunken pre-battle carousing, and no nervous neophytes stayed up worrying about the battle to come.  As soon as the sun sank beneath the wooded hills, the camp was at rest, but for the sentries.\n20 First Seed, 2920\nBodrum, Morrowind\nMiramor was exhausted.  For last six days, he had gambled and whored all night and then marched all day.  He was looking forward to the battle, but even more than that, he was looking forward to some rest afterwards.  He was in the Emperor's command at the rear flank, which was good because it seemed unlikely that he would be killed.  On the other hand, it meant traveling over the mud and waste the army ahead left in their wake.\nAs they began the trek through the wildflower field, Miramor and all the soldiers around him sank ankle-deep in cold mud.  It was an effort to even keep moving.  Far, far up ahead, he could see the vanguard of the army led by Lord Storig emerging from the meadow at the base of a bluff.\nThat was when it all happened.\nAn army of Dunmer appeared above the bluff like rising Daedra, pouring fire and floods of arrows down on the vanguard.  Simultaneously, a company of men bearing the flag of the Duke of Mournhold galloped around the shore, disappearing along the shallow river's edge where it dipped to a timbered glen to the east.  Warchief Ulaqth nearby on the right flank let out a bellow of revenge at the sight and gave chase.  Queen Naghea sent her flank towards the embankment to the west to intercept the army on the bluff.\nThe Emperor could think of nothing to do.  His troops were too bogged down to move forward quickly and join the battle.  He ordered them to face east towards the timber, in case Mournhold's company was trying to circle around through the woods.  They never came out, but many men, facing west, missed the battle entirely.  Miramor kept his eyes on the bluff.\nA tall Dunmer he supposed must have been Vivec gave a signal, and the battlemages cast their spells at something to the west.  From what transpired, Miramor deduced it was a dam.  A great torrent of water spilled out, washing Naghea's left flank into the remains of the vanguard and the two together down river to the east.\nThe Emperor paused, as if waiting for his vanquished army to return, and then called a retreat.  Miramor hid in the rushes until they had passed by and then waded as quietly as he could to the bluff.\nThe Morrowind army was retiring as well back to their camp.  He could hear them celebrating above him as he padded along the shore.  To the east, he saw the Imperial Army.  They had been washed into a net of spears strung across the river, Naghea's left flank on Storig's vanguard on Ulaqth's right flank, bodies of hundreds of soldiers strung together like beads.\nMiramor took whatever valuables he could carry from the corpses and then ran down the river.  He had to go many miles before the water was clear again, unpolluted by blood.\n29 First Seed, 2920\nHegathe, Hammerfell\n\"You have a letter from the Imperial City,\" said the chief priestess, handing the parchment to Corda.  All the young priestesses smiled and made faces of astonishment, but the truth was that Corda's sister Rijja wrote very often, at least once a month.\nCorda took the letter to the garden to read it, her favorite place, an oasis in the monochromatic sand-colored world of the conservatorium  The letter itself was nothing unusual: filled with court gossip, the latest fashions which were tending to winedark velvets, and reports of the Emperor's ever-growing paranoia.\n\"You are so lucky to be away from all of this,\" wrote Rijja. \"The Emperor is convinced that his latest battlefield fiasco is all a result of spies in the palace.  He has even taken to questioning me.  Ruptga keep it so you never have a life as interesting as mine.\"\nCorda listened to the sounds of the desert and prayed to Ruptga the exact opposite wish.\nThe Year is Continued in Rain's Hand.\n2920, Rain's Hand, Book 4\nRain's Hand\nBook Four of 2920, \nThe Last Year of the First Era\nBy\nCarlovac Townway\n3 Rain's Hand, 2920\nColdharbour, Oblivion\nSotha Sil proceeded as quickly as he could through the blackened halls of the palace, half-submerged in brackish water.  All around him, nasty gelatinous creatures scurried into the reeds, bursts of white fire lit up the upper arches of the hall before disappearing, and smells assaulted him, rancid death one moment, sweet flowered perfume the next.  Several times he had visited the Daedra princes in their Oblivion, but every time, something different awaited him.\nHe knew his purpose, and refused to be distracted.\nEight of the more prominent Daedra princes were awaiting him in the half-melted, domed room.  Azura, Prince of Dusk and Dawn; Boethiah, Prince of Plots; Herma-Mora, Daedra of Knowledge; Hircine, the Hunter; Malacath, God of Curses; Mehrunes Dagon, Prince of Disaster; Molag Bal, Prince of Rage; Sheogorath, the Mad One.\nAbove them, the sky cast tormented shadows upon the meeting.\n5 Rain's Hand, 2920\nThe Isle of Artaeum, Summurset\nSotha Sil's voice cried out, echoing from the cave, \"Move the rock!\"\nImmediately, the initiates obeyed, rolling aside the great boulder that blocked the entrance to the Dreaming Cavern.  Sotha Sil emerged, his face smeared with ash, weary.  He felt he had been away for months, years, but only a few days had transpired.  Lilatha took his arm to help him walk, but he refused her help with a kind smile and a shake of his head.\n\"Were you ... successful?\" she asked.\n\"The Daedra princes I spoke with have agreed to our terms,\" he said flatly. \"Disasters such as befell Gilverdale should be averted.  Only through certain intermediaries such as witches or sorcerers will they answer the call of man and mer.\"\n\"And what did you promise them in return?\" asked the Nord boy Welleg.\n\"The deals we make with Daedra,\" said Sotha Sil, continuing on to Iachesis's palace to meet with the Master of the Psijic Order. \"Should not be discussed with the innocent.\"\n\n8 Rain's Hand, 2920\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil\nA storm billeted the windows of the Prince's bedchamber, bringing a smell of moist air to mix with the censors filled with burning incense and herbs.\n\"A letter has arrived from the Empress, your mother,\" said the courier. \"Anxiously inquiring after your health.\"\n\"What frightened parents I have!\" laughed Prince Juilek from his bed.\n\"It is only natural for a mother to worry,\" said Savirien-Chorak, the Potentate's son.\n\"There is everything unnatural about my family, Akavir.  My exiled mother fears that my father will imagine me of being a traitor, covetous of the crown, and is having me poisoned,\" the Prince sank back into his pillow, annoyed. \"The Emperor has insisted on me having a taster for all my meals as he does.\"\n\"There are many plots,\" agreed the Akavir. \"You have been abed for nearly three weeks with every healer in the empire shuffling through like a slow ballroom dance.  At least, all can see that you're getting stronger.\"\n\"Strong enough to lead the vanguard against Morrowind soon, I hope,\" said Juilek.\n11 Rain's Hand, 2920\nThe Isle of Artaeum, Summurset\nThe initiates stood quietly in a row along the arbor loggia, watching the long, deep, marble-lined trench ahead of them flash with fire.  The air above it vibrated with the waves of heat.  Though each student kept his or her face sturdy and emotionless, as a true Psijic should, their terror was nearly as palpable as the heat.  Sotha Sil closed his eyes and uttered the charm of fire resistance.  Slowly, he walked across the basin of leaping flames, climbing to the other side, unscathed.  Not even his white robe had been burned.\n\"The charm is intensified by the energy you bring to it, by your own skills, just as all spells are,\" he said. \"Your imagination and your willpower are the keys.  There is no need for a spell to give you a resistance to air, or a resistance to flowers, and after you cast the charm, you must forget there is even a need for a spell to give you resistance to fire.  Do not confuse what I am saying: resistance is not about ignoring the fire's reality.  You will feel the substance of flame, the texture of it, its hunger, and even the heat of it, but you will know that it will not hurt or injure you.\"\nThe students nodded and one by one, they cast the spell and made the walk through the fire.  Some even went so far as to bend over and scoop up a handful of fire and feed it air, so it expanded like a bubble and melted through their fingers.  Sotha Sil smiled.  They were fighting their fear admirably.\nThe Chief Proctor Thargallith came running from the arbor arches, \"Sotha Sil!  Almalexia has arrived on Artaeum.  Iachesis told me to fetch you.\"\nSotha Sil turned to Thargallith for only a moment, but he knew instantly from the screams what had transpired.  The Nord lad Wellig had not cast the spell properly and was burning.  The smell of scorched hair and flesh panicked the other students who were struggling to get out of the basin, pulling him with them, but the incline was too steep away from the entry points.  With a wave of his hand, Sotha Sil extinguished the flame.\nWellig and several other students were burned, but not badly.  The sorcerer cast a healing spell on them, before turning back to Thargallith.\n\"I'll be with you in a moment, and give Almalexia the time to shake the road dust from her train,\" Sotha Sil turned back to the students, his voice flat. \"Fear does not break spells, but doubt and incompetence are the great enemies of any spellcaster.  Master Welleg, you will pack your bags.  I'll arrange for a boat to bring you to the mainland tomorrow morning.\"\nThe sorcerer found Almalexia and Iachesis in the study, drinking hot tea, and laughing.  She was more beautiful than he had remembered, though he had never before seen her so disheveled, wrapped in a blanket, dangling her damp long black tresses before the fire to dry.  At Sotha Sil's approach, she leapt to her feet and embraced him.\n\"Did you swim all the way from Morrowind?\" he smiled.\n\"It's pouring rain from Skywatch down to the coast,\" she explained, returning his smile.\n\"Only a half a league away, and it never rains here,\" said Iachesis proudly. \"Of course, I sometimes miss the excitement of Summurset, and sometimes even the mainland itself.  Still, I'm always very impressed by anyone out there who gets anything accomplished.  It is a world of distractions.  Speaking of distractions, what's all this I hear about a war?\"\n\"You mean the one that's been bloodying the continent for the last eighty years, Master?\" asked Sotha Sil, amused.\n\"I suppose that's the one I mean,\" said Iachesis with a shrug of his shoulders. \"How is that war going?\"\n\"We will lose it, unless I can convince Sotha Sil to leave Artaeum,\" said Almalexia, losing her smile.  She had meant to wait and talk to her friend in private, but the old Altmer gave her courage to press on. \"I have had visions; I know it to be true.\"\nSotha Sil was silent for a moment, and then looked at Iachesis, \"I must return to Morrowind.\"\n\"Knowing you, if you must do something, you will,\" sighed the old Master. \"The Psijics' way is not to be distracted.  Wars are fought, Empires rise and fall.  You must go, and so must we.\"\n\"What do you mean, Iachesis?  You're leaving the island?\"\n\"No, the island will be leaving the sea,\" said Iachesis, his voice taking on a dreamy quality. \"In a few years, the mists will move over Artaeum and we will be gone.  We are counselors by nature, and there are too many counselors in Tamriel as it is.  No, we will go, and return when the land needs us again, perhaps in another age.\"\nThe old Altmer struggles to his feet, and drained the last sip of his drink before leaving Sotha Sil and Almalexia alone: \"Don't miss the last boat.\"\nThe Year Continues in Second Seed.\n2920, Second Seed, Book 5\nSecond Seed\nBook Five of 2920, \nThe Last Year of the First Era\nBy\nCarlovac Townway\n10 Second Seed, 2920\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil\n\"Your Imperial Majesty,\" said the Potentate Versidue-Shaie, opening the door to his chamber with a smile. \"I have not seen you lately. I thought perhaps you were ... indisposed with the lovely Rijja.\"\n\"She's taking the baths at Mir Corrup,\" the Emperor Reman III said miserably.\n\"Please, come in.\"\n\"I've reached the stage where I can only trust three people: you, my son the Prince, and Rijja,\" said the Emperor petulantly. \"My entire council is nothing but a pack of spies.\"\n\"What seems to be the matter, your imperial majesty?\" asked the Potentate Versidue-Shaie sympathetically, drawing closed the thick curtain in his chamber. Instantly all sound outside the room was extinguished, echoing footsteps in the marble halls and birds in the springtide gardens.\n\"I've discovered that a notorious poisoner, an Orma tribeswoman from Black Marsh called Catchica, was with the army at Caer Suvio while we were encamped there when my son was poisoned, before the battle at Bodrum. I'm sure she would have preferred to kill me, but the opportunity didn't present itself,\" The Emperor fumed. \"The Council suggests that we need evidence of her involvement before we prosecute.\"\n\"Of course they would,\" said the Potentate thoughtfully. \"Particularly if one or more of them was in on the plot. I have a thought, your imperial majesty.\"\n\"Yes?\" said Reman impatiently. \"Out with it!\"\n\"Tell the Council you're dropping the matter, and I will send out the Guard to track this Catchica down and follow her. We will see who her friends are, and perhaps get an idea of the scope of this plot on your imperial majesty's life.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Reman with a satisfied frown. \"That's a capital plan. We will track this scheme to whomever it leads to.\"\n\"Decidedly, your imperial majesty,\" smiled the Potentate, parting the curtain so the Emperor could leave. In the hallway outside was Versidue-Shaie's son, Savirien-Chorak. The boy bowed to the Emperor before entering the Potentate's chamber.\n\"Are you in trouble, father?\" whispered the Akaviri lad. \"I heard the Emperor found out about whatshername, the poisoner.\"\n\"The great art of speechcraft, my boy,\" said Versidue-Shaie to his son. \"Is to tell them what they want to hear in a way that gets them to do what you want them to do. I need you to get a letter to Catchica, and make certain that she understands that if she does not follow the instructions perfectly, she is risking her own life more than ours.\"\n13 Second Seed, 2920\nMir Corrup, Cyrodiil\nRijja sank luxuriantly into the burbling hot spring, feeling her skin tingle like it was being rubbed by millions of little stones. The rock shelf over her head sheltered her from the misting rain, but let all the sunshine in, streaming in layers through the branches of the trees. It was an idyllic moment in an idyllic life, and when she was finished she knew that her beauty would be entirely restored. The only thing she needed was a drink of water. The bath itself, while wonderfully fragrant, tasted always of chalk.\n\"Water!\" she cried to her servants. \"Water, please!\"\nA gaunt woman with rags tied over her eyes ran to her side and dropped a goatskin of water. Rijja was about to laugh at the woman's prudery -- she herself was not ashamed of her naked body -- but then she noticed through a crease in the rags that the old woman had no eyes at all. She was like one of those Orma tribesmen Rijja had heard about, but never met. Born without eyes, they were masters of their other senses. The Lord of Mir Corrup hired very exotic servants, she thought to herself.\nIn a moment, the woman was gone and forgotten. Rijja found it very hard to concentrate on anything but the sun and the water. She opened the cork, but the liquid within had a strange, metallic smell to it. Suddenly, she was aware that she was not alone.\n\"Lady Rijja,\" said the captain of the Imperial Guard. \"You are, I see, acquainted with Catchica?\"\n\"I've never heard of her,\" stammered Rijja before becoming indignant. \"What are you doing here? This body is not for your leering eyes.\"\n\"Never heard of her, when we saw her with you not a minute ago,\" said the captain, picking up the goatskin and smelling it. \"Brought you neivous ichor, did she? To poison the Emperor with?\"\n\"Captain,\" said one of the guards, running up to him quickly. \"We cannot find the Argonian. It is as if she disappeared into the woods.\"\n\"Yes, they're good at that,\" said the captain. \"No matter though. We've got her contact at court. That should please his Imperial Majesty. Seize her.\"\nAs the guards pulled the writhing naked woman from the pool, she screamed, \"I'm innocent! I don't know what this is all about, but I've done nothing! The Emperor will have your heads for this!\"\n\"Yes, I imagine he will,\" smiled the captain. \"If he trusts you.\"\n21 Second Seed, 2920\nGideon, Black Marsh\nThe Sow and Vulture tavern was the sort of out-of-the-way place that Zuuk favored for these sorts of interviews. Besides himself and his companion, there were only a couple of old seadogs in the shadowy room, and they were more unconscious from drink than aware. The grime of the unwashed floor was something you felt rather than saw. Copious dust hung in the air unmoving in the sparse rays of dying sunlight.\n\"You have experience in heavy combat?\" asked Zuuk. \"The reward is good for this assignment, but the risks are great as well.\"\n\"Certainly I have combat experience,\" replied Miramor haughtily. \"I was at the Battle of Bodrum just two months ago. If you do your part and get the Emperor to ride through Dozsa Pass with a minimal escort on the day and the time we've discussed, I'll do my part. Just be certain that he's not traveling in disguise. I'm not going to slaughter every caravan that passes through in the hopes that it contains Emperor Reman.\"\nZuuk smiled, and Miramor looked at himself in the Kothringi's reflective face. He liked the way he looked: the consummate confident professional.\n\"Agreed,\" said Zuuk. \"And then you shall have the rest of your gold.\"\nZuuk placed the large chest onto the table between them. He stood up.\n\"Wait a few minutes before leaving,\" said Zuuk. \"I don't want you following me. Your employers wish to maintain their anonymity, if by chance you are caught and tortured.\"\n\"Fine by me,\" said Miramor, ordering more grog.\nZuuk rode his mount through the cramped labyrinthine streets of Gideon, and both he and his horse were happy to pass through the gates into the country. The main road to Castle Giovese was flooded as it was every year in springtide, but Zuuk knew a shorter way over the hills. Riding fast under trees drooping with moss and treacherous slime-coated rocks, he arrived at the castle gates in two hours' time. He wasted no time in climbing to Tavia's cell at the top of the highest tower.\n\"What did you think of him?\" asked the Empress.\n\"He's a fool,\" replied Zuuk. \"But that's what we want for this sort of assignment.\"\n30 Second Seed, 2920\nThurzo Fortress, Cyrodiil\nRijja screamed and screamed and screamed. Within her cell, her only audience was the giant gray stones, crusted with moss but still sturdy. The guards outside were deaf to her as they were deaf to all prisoners. The Emperor, miles away in the Imperial City, had likewise been deaf to her cries of innocence.\nShe screamed knowing well that no one would likely hear her ever again.\n31 Second Seed, 2920\nKavas Rim Pass, Cyrodiil\nIt had been days, weeks since Turala had seen another human face, Cyrodiil or Dunmer. As she trod the road, she thought to herself how strange it was that such an uninhabited place as Cyrodiil had become the Imperial Province, seat of an Empire. Even the Bosmer in Valenwood must have more populated forests than this Heartland wood.\nShe thought back. Was it a month ago, two, when she crossed the border from Morrowind into Cyrodiil? It had been much colder then, but other than that, she had no sense of time. The guards had been brusque, but as she was carrying no weaponry, they elected to let her through. Since then, she had seen a few caravans, even shared a meal with some adventurers camping for the night, but met no one who would give her a ride to a town.\nTurala stripped off her shawl and dragged it behind her. For a moment, she thought she heard someone behind her and spun around. No one was there. Just a bird perched on a branch making a sound like laughter.\nShe walked on, and then stopped. Something was happening. The child had been kicking in her belly for some time now, but this was a different kind of spasm. With a groan, she lurched over to the side of the path, collapsing into the grass. Her child was coming.\nShe lay on her back and pushed, but she could barely see with her tears of pain and frustration. How had it come to this? Giving birth in the wilderness, all by herself, to a child whose father was the Duke of Mournhold? Her scream of rage and agony shook the birds from the trees.\nThe bird that had been laughing at her earlier flew down to the road. She blinked, and the bird was gone and in its place, a naked Elf man stood, not as dark as a Dunmer, but not as pale as the Altmer. She knew at once it was an Ayleid, a Wild Elf. Turala screamed, but the man held her down. After a few minutes of struggle, she felt a release, and then fainted away.\nWhen she awoke, it was to the sound of a baby crying. The child had been cleaned and was lying by her side. Turala picked up her baby girl, and for the first time that year, felt tears of happiness stream down her face.\nShe whispered to the trees, \"Thank you\" and began walking with babe in her arms down the road to the west.\nThe Year Is Continued in Mid Year.\n2920, Midyear, Book 6\nMid Year\nBook Six of 2920\nThe Last Year of the First Era\nby\nCarlovac Townway\n2 Mid Year, 2920\nBalmora, Morrowind\n2 Mid Year, 2920\nBalmora, Morrowind\nThe Imperial army is gathered to the south,\" said Cassyr. \"They are a two weeks march from Ald Iuval and Lake Coronati, heavily armored.\"\nVivec nodded.  Ald Iuval and its sister city on the other side of the lake Ald Malak were strategically important fortresses.  He had been expecting a move against them for some time.  His captain pulled down a map of southwestern Morrowind from the wall and smoothed it out, fighting a gentle summer sea breeze wafting in from the open window.\n\"They were heavily armored, you say?\" asked the captain.\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Cassyr. \"They were camped out near Bethal Gray in the Heartland, and I saw nothing but Ebony, Dwarven, and Daedric armor, fine weaponry, and siege equipment.\"\n\"How about spellcasters and boats?\" asked Vivec.\n\"A horde of battlemages,\" replied Cassyr. \"But no boats.\"\n\"As heavily armored as they are, it will take them at least two weeks, like you said, to get from Bethal Gray to Lake Coronati,\" Vivec studied the map carefully. \"They'd be dragged down in the bogs if they then tried to circle around to Ald Marak from the north, so they must be planning to cross the straits here and take Ald Iuval.  Then they'd proceed around the lake to the east and take Ald Marak from the south.\"\n\"They'll be vulnerable along the straits,\" said the captain. \"Provided we strike when they are more than halfway across and can't retreat back to the Heartland.\"\n\"Your intelligence has once again served us well,\" said Vivec, smiling to Cassyr. \"We will beat back the Imperial aggressors yet again.\"\n3 Mid Year, 2920\nBethal Gray, Cyrodiil\n\"Will you be returning back this way after your victory?\" asked Lord Bethal.\nPrince Juilek barely paid the man any attention.  He was focused on the army packing its camp. It was a cool morning in the forest, but there were no clouds.  All the makings of a hot afternoon march, particularly in such heavy armor.\n\"If we return shortly, it will be because of defeat,\" said the Prince.  He could see down in the meadow, the Potentate Versidue-Shaie paying his lordship's steward for the use of the village's food, wine, and whores.  An army was an expensive thing, for certes.\n\"My Prince,\" said Lord Bethal with concern. \"Is your army beginning a march due east?  That will just lead you to the shores of Lake Coronati.  You'll want to go south-east to get to the straits.\"\n\"You just make certain your merchants get their share of our gold,\" said the Prince with a grin. \"Let me worry about my army's direction.\"\n16 Mid Year, 2920\nLake Coronati, Morrowind\nVivec stared across the blue expanse of the lake, seeing his reflection and the reflection of his army in the cool blue waters.  What he did not see was the Imperial Army's reflection.  They must have reached the straits by now, barring any mishaps in the forest.  Tall feather-thin lake trees blocked much of his view of the straits, but an army, particularly one clan in slow-moving heavy armor could not move invisibly, silently.\n\"Let me see the map again,\" he called to his captain. \"Is there no other way they could approach?\"\n\"We have sentries posted in the swamps to the north in case they're fool enough to go there and be bogged under,\" said the captain. \"We would at least hear about it.  But there is no other way across the lake except through the straits.\"\nVivec looked down again at his reflection, which seemed to be distorting his image, mocking him.  Then he looked back on the map.\n\"Spy,\" said Vivec, calling Cassyr over. \"When you said the army had a horde of battlemages, what made you so certain they were battlemages?\"\n\"They were wearing gray robes with mystical insignia on them,\" explained Cassyr. \"I figured they were mages, and why else would such a vast number travel with the army?  They couldn't have all been healers.\"\n\"You fool!\" roared Vivec. \"They're mystics schooled in the art of Alteration.  They've cast a spell of water breathing on the entire army.\"\nVivec ran to a new vantage point where he could see the north.  Across the lake, though it was but a small shadow on the horizon, they could see gouts of flame from the assault on Ald Marak.  Vivec bellowed with fury and his captain got to work at once redirecting the army to circle the lake and defend the castle.\n\"Return to Dwynnen,\" said Vivec flatly to Cassyr before he rode off to join the battle. \"Your services are no longer needed nor wanted.\"\nIt was already too late when the Morrowind army neared Ald Marak.  It had been taken by the Imperial Army.\n19 Mid Year, 2920\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil\nThe Potentate arrived in the Imperial City amid great fanfare, the streets lined with men and women cheering him as the symbol of the taking of Ald Marak.  Truth be told, a greater number would have turned out had the Prince returned, and the Versidue-Shaie knew it.  Still, it pleased him to no end.  Never before had citizens of Tamriel cheered the arrival of an Akaviri into their land.\nThe Emperor Reman III greeted him with a warm embrace, and then tore into the letter he had brought from the Prince.\n\"I don't understand,\" he said at last, still joyous but equally confused. \"You went under the lake?\"\n\"Ald Marak is a very well-fortified fortress,\" explained the Potentate. \"As, I might add, the army of Morrowind has rediscovered, now that they are on the outside.  To take it, we had to attack by surprise and with our soldiery in the sturdiest of armor.  By casting the spell that allowed us to breathe underwater, we were able to travel faster than Vivec would have guessed, the weight of the armor made less by the aquatic surroundings, and attack from the waterbound west side of the fortress where their defenses were at their weakest.\"\n\"Brilliant!\" the Emperor crowed. \"You are a wonderous tactician, Versidue-Shaie!  If your fathers had been as good at this as you are, Tamriel would be Akaviri domain!\"\nThe Potentate had not planned to take credit for Prince Juilek's design, but on the Emperor's reference to his people's fiasco of an invasion two hundred and sixteen years ago, he made up his mind.  He smiled modestly and soaked up the praise.\n21 Mid Year, 2920\nAld Marak, Morrowind\nSavirien-Chorak slithered to the wall and watched through the arrow slit the Morrowind army retreating back to the forestland between the swamps and the castle grounds.  It seemed like the idea opportunity to strike.  Perhaps the forests could be burned and the army within them.  Perhaps with Vivec in their enemies' hands, the army would allow them possession of Ald Iuval as well.  He suggested these ideas to the Prince.\n\"What you seem to be forgetting,\" laughed Prince Juilek. \"Is that I gave my word that no harm to the army or to their commanders during the truce negotiations.  Do you not have honor during warfare on Akavir?\"\n\"My Prince, I was born here in Tamriel, I have never been to my people's home,\" replied the snake man. \"But even so, your ways are strange to me.  You expected no quarter and I gave you none when we fought in the Imperial Arena five months ago.\"\n\"That was a game,\" replied the Prince, before nodding to his steward to let the Dunmer battle chief in.\nJuilek had never seen Vivec before, but he had heard he was a living god.  What came before him was but a man.  A powerfully built man, handsome, with an intelligent face, but a man nonetheless.  The Prince was pleased: a man he could speak with, but not a god.\n\"Greetings, my worthy adversary,\" said Vivec. \"We seem to be at an impasse.\"\n\"Not necessarily,\" said the Prince. \"You don't want to give us Morrowind, and I can't fault you for that.  But I must have your coastline to protect the Empire from overseas aggressions, and certain key strategic border castles, such as this one, as well as Ald Umbeil, Tel Aruhn, Ald Lambasi, and Tel Mothrivra.\"\n\"And in return?\" asked Vivec.\n\"In return?\" laughed Savirien-Chorak. \"You forget we are the victors here, not you.\"\n\"In return,\" said Prince Juilek carefully. \"There will be no Imperial attacks on Morrowind, unless in return to an attack by you.  You will be protected from invaders by the Imperial navy.  And your land may expand by taking certain estates in Black Marsh, whichever you choose, provided they are not needed by the Empire.\"\n\"A reasonable offer,\" said Vivec after a pause.  \"You must forgive me, I am unused to Cyrodiils who offer something in return for what they take.  May I have a few days to decide?\"\n\"We will meet again in a week's time,\" said the Prince, smiling. \"In the meantime, if your army provokes no attacks on mine, we are at peace.\"\nVivec left the Prince's chamber, feeling that Almalexia was right.  The war was at an end.  This Prince would make an excellent Emperor.\nThe Year is Continued in Sun's Height.\n\n2920, Sun's Height, Book 7\nSun's Height\nBook Seven of 2920\nThe Last Year of the First Era\nby\nCarlovac Townway\n\n4 Sun's Height, 2920\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil\nThe Emperor Reman III and his Potentate Versidue-Shaie took a stroll around the Imperial Gardens.  Studded with statuary and fountains, the north gardens fit the Emperor's mood, as well as being the coolest acreage in the City during the heat of summertide.  Austere, tiered flowerbeds of blue-gray and green towered all around them as they walked.\n\"Vivec has agreed to the Prince's terms for peace,\" said Reman. \"My son will be returning in two weeks' time.\"\n\"This is excellent news,\" said the Potentate carefully.  \"I hope the Dunmer will honor the terms.  We might have asked for more.  The fortress at Black Gate, for example.  But I suppose the Prince knows what is reasonable.  He would not cripple the Empire just for peace.\"\n\"I have been thinking lately of Rijja and what caused her to plot against my life,\" said the Emperor, pausing to admire a statue of the Slave Queen Alessia before continuing. \"The only thing I can think of to account for it is that she admired my son too much.  She may have loved me for my power and my personality, but he, after all, is young and handsome and will one day inherit my throne.  She must have thought that if I were dead, she could have an Emperor who had both youth and power.\"\n\"The Prince ... was in on this plot?\" asked Versidue-Shaie.  It was a difficult game to play, anticipating where the Emperor's paranoia would strike next.\n\"Oh, I don't think so,\" said Reman, smiling. \"No, my son loves me well.\"\n\"Are you aware that Corda, Raja's sister in an initiate of the Morwha conservatorium in Hegathe?\" asked the Potentate.\n\"Morwha?\" asked the Emperor. \"I've forgotten: which god is that?\"\n\"Lusty fertility goddess of the Yokudans,\" replied the Potentate. \"But not too lusty, like Dibella. Demure, but certainly sexual.\"\n\"I am through with lusty women. The Empress, Rijja, all too lusty, a lust for love leads to a lust for power,\" the Emperor shrugged his shoulders. \"But a priestess-in-training with a certain healthy appetite sounds ideal.  Now what were you saying about the Black Gate?\"\n\n6 Sun's Height, 2920\nThurzo Fortress, Cyrodiil\nRijja stood quietly looking at the cold stone floor while the Emperor spoke.  He had never before seen her so pale and joyless.  She might at least be pleased that she was being freed, being returned to her homeland.  Why, if she left now, she could be in Hammerfell by the Merchant's Festival.  Nothing he said seemed to register any reaction from her.  A month and a half's stay in Thurzo Fortress seemed to have killed her spirit.\n\"I was thinking,\" said the Emperor at last. \"Of having your younger sister Corda up to the palace for a time.  I think she would prefer it over the conservatorium in Hegathe, don't you?\"\nReaction, at last. Rijja looked at the Emperor with animal hatred, flinging herself at him in a rage.  Her fingernails had grown long since her imprisonment and she raked them across his face, into his eyes.  He howled with pain, and his guards pulled her off, pummeling her with blows from the back of their swords, until she was knocked unconscious.\nA healer was called at once, but the Emperor Reman III had lost his right eye.\n\n23 Sun's Height, 2920\nBalmora, Morrowind\nVivec pulled himself from the water, feeling the heat of the day washed from his skin, taking a towel from one of his servants. Sotha Sil watched his old friend from the balcony.\n\"It looks like you've picked up a few more scars since I last saw you,\" said the sorcerer.\n\"Azura grant it that I have no more for a while,\" laughed Vivec. \"When did you arrive?\"\n\"A little over an hour ago,\" said Sotha Sil, walking down the stairs to the water's edge. \"I thought I was coming to end a war, but it seems you've done it without me.\"\n\"Yes, eighty years is long enough for ceaseless battle,\" replied Vivec, embracing Sotha Sil. \"We made concessions, but so did they.  When the old Emperor is dead, we may be entering a golden age.  Prince Juilek is very wise for his age.  Where is Almalexia?\"\n\"Collecting the Duke of Mournhold.  They should be here tomorrow afternoon.\"\nThe men were distracted at a sight from around the corner of the palace - a rider was approaching through the town, heading for the front steps.  It was evident that the woman had been riding hard for some time.  They met her in the study, where she burst in, breathing hard.\n\"We have been betrayed,\" she gasped. \"The Imperial Army has seized the Black Gate.\"\n\n24 Sun's Height, 2920\nBalmora, Morrowind\nIt was the first time in seventeen years that the three members of the Morrowind Tribunal had met in the same place, since Sotha Sil had left for Artaeum.  All three wished that the circumstances of their reunion were different.\n\"From what we've learned, while the Prince was returning to Cyrodiil to the south, a second Imperial Army came down from the north,\" said Vivec to his stony-faced compatriots. \"It is reasonable to assume Juilek didn't know about the attack.\"\n\"But neither would it be unreasonable to suppose that he planned on being a distraction while the Emperor launched the attack on Black Gate,\" said Sotha Sil. \"This must be considered a break of the truce.\"\n\"Where is the Duke of Mournhold?\" asked Vivec. \"I would hear his thoughts on the matter.\"\n\"He is meeting with the Night Mother in Tel Aruhn,\" said Almalexia, quietly. \"I told him to wait until he had spoken with you, but he said that the matter had waited long enough.\"\n\"He would involve the Morag Tong? In outside affairs?\" Vivec shook his head, and looked to Sotha Sil: \"Please, do what you can. Assassination will only move us backwards.  This matter must be settled with diplomacy or battle.\"\n\n25 Sun's Height, 2920\nTel Aruhn, Morrowind\nThe Night Mother met Sotha Sil in her salon, lit only by the moon.  She was cruelly beautiful dressed in a simple silk black robe, lounging across her divan.  With a gesture, she dismissed her red-cloaked guards and offered the sorcerer some wine.\n\"You've only just missed your friend, the Duke,\" she whispered. \"He was very unhappy, but I think we will solve his problem for him.\"\n\"Did he hire the Morag Tong to assassinate the Emperor?\" asked Sotha Sil.\n\"You are straight-forward, aren't you? That's good.  I love plain-speaking men: it saves so much time. Of course, I cannot discuss with you what the Duke and I talked about,\" she smiled. \"It would be bad for business.\"\n\"What if I were to offer you an equal amount of gold for you not to assassinate the Emperor?\"\n\"The Morag Tong murders for the glory of Mephala and for profit,\" she said, speaking into her glass of wine. \"We do not merely kill.  That would be sacrilege. Once the Duke's gold has arrived in three days time, we will do our end of the business.  And I'm afraid we would not dream of entertaining a counter offer.  Though we are a business as well as a religious order, we do not bow to supply and demand, Sotha Sil.\"\n27 Sun's Height, 2920\nThe Inner Sea, Morrowind\nSotha Sil had been watching the waters for two days now, waiting for a particular vessel, and now he saw it.  A heavy ship with the flag of Mournhold.  The sorcerer took the air and intercepted it before it reached harbor.  A caul of flame erupted over his figure, disguising his voice and form into that of a Daedra.\n\"Abandon your ship!\" he bellowed. \"If you would not sink with it!\"\nIn truth, Sotha Sil could have exploded the vessel with but a single ball of fire, but he chose to take his time, to give the crew a chance to dive off into the warm water.  When he was certain there was no one living aboard, he focused his energy into a destructive wave that shook the air and water as it discharged.  The ship and the Duke's payment to the Morag Tong sunk to the bottom of the Inner Sea.\n\"Night Mother,\" thought Sotha Sil, as he floated towards shore to alert the harbormaster that some sailors were in need of rescue. \"Everyone bows to supply and demand.\"\nThe Year is Continued in Last Seed.\n2920, Last Seed, Book 8\nLast Seed\nBook Eight of 2920 \nThe Last Year of the First Era\nby\nCarlovac Townway\n\n1 Last Seed, 2920\nMournhold, Morrowind\nThey were gathered in the Duke's courtyard at twilight, enjoying the smell and warmth of a fire of dry branches and bittergreen leaves.  Tiny embers flew into the sky, hanging for a few moments before vanishing.\n\"I was rash,\" agreed the Duke, soberly. \"But Lorkhan had his laugh, and all is well.  The Morag Tong will not assassinate the Emperor now that my payment to them is at the bottom of the Inner Sea.  I thought you had made some sort of a truce with the Daedra princes.\"\n\"What your sailors called a daedra may not have been one,\" said Sotha Sil. \"Perhaps it was a rogue battlemage or even a lightning bolt that destroyed your ship.\"\n\"The Prince and the Emperor are en route to take possession of Ald Lambasi as our truce agreed.  It is certainly typical of the Cyrodiil to assume that their concessions are negotiable, while ours are not,\" Vivec pulled out a map. \"We can meet them here, in this village to the north-west of Ald Lambasi, Fervinthil.\"\n\"But will we meet them to talk,\" ask Almalexia. \"Or to make war?\"\nNo one had an answer to that.\n15 Last Seed, 2920\nFervinthil, Morrowind\nA late summer squall blew through the small village, darkening the sky except for flashing of lightning which leapt from cloud to cloud like acrobats.  Water rushed down the narrow streets ankle-deep, and the Prince had to shout to be heard by his captains but a few feet away from him.\n\"There's an inn up ahead!  We'll wait there for the storm to pass before pressing on to Ald Lambasi!\"\nThe inn was warm and dry, and bustling with business.  Barmaids were rushing back and forth, bringing greef and wine to a back room, evidently excited about a famous visitor.  Someone who was attracting more attention than the mere heir to the Empire of Tamriel.  Amused, Juilek watched them run until he overheard the name of \"Vivec.\"\n\"My Lord Vivec,\" he said, bursting into the back room. \"You must believe me, I knew nothing about the attack on Black Gate until after it happened.  We will, of course, be returning it to your care forthwith.  I wrote you a letter to that effect at your palace in Balmora, but obviously you're not there,\" he paused, taking in the many new faces in the room. \"I'm sorry, let me introduce myself.  I'm Juilek Cyrodiil.\"\n\"My name is Almalexia,\" said the most beautiful woman the Prince had ever seen. \"Won't you join us?\"\n\"Sotha Sil,\" said a serious-looking Dunmer in a white cloak, shaking the Prince's hand and showing him to a seat.\n\"Indoril Brindisi Dorom, Duke-Prince of Mournhold,\" said the massively-built man next to him as he sat down.\n\"I recognize that the events of the last month suggest, at best, that the Imperial Army is not under my control,\" said the Prince after ordering some wine. \"This is true.  The army is my father's.\"\n\"I understood that the Emperor was going to be coming to Ald Lambasi as well,\" said Almalexia.\n\"Officially, he is,\" said the Prince cautiously. \"Unofficially, he's still back in the Imperial City.  He's met with an unfortunate accident.\"\nVivec glanced the Duke quickly before looking at the Prince: \"An accident?\"\n\"He's fine,\" said the Prince quickly. \"He'll live, but it looks like he'll lose an eye. It was an altercation that has nothing to do with the war. The only good news is that while he recovers, I have the use of his seal.  Any agreement we make here and now will be binding to the Empire, both in my father's reign and in mine.\"\n\"Then let's start agreeing,\" smiled Almalexia.\n16 Last Seed, 2920\nWroth Naga, Cyrodiil\nThe tiny hamlet of Wroth Naga greeted Cassyr with its colorful houses perched on a promontory overlooking the stretch of the Wrothgarian mountain plain and High Rock beyond.  Had he been in a better mood, the sight would have been breathtaking.  As it was, he could only think that in practical terms, a small village like this would have meager provisions for himself and his horse.\nHe rode down into the main square, where an inn called the Eagle's Cry stood.  Directing the stable boy to house and feed his horse, Cassyr walked into the inn and was surprised by its ambience.  A minstrel he had heard play once in Gilderdale was performing a jaunty old tune to the clapping of the mountain men.  Such forced merriment was not what Cassyr wanted at that moment.  A glum Dunmer woman was seated at the only table far from the noise, so he took his drink there and sat down without invitation.  It was only when he did so that he noticed that she was holding a newborn baby.\n\"I've just come from Morrowind,\" he said rather awkwardly, lowering his voice. \"I've been fighting for Vivec and the Duke of Mournhold against the Imperial army.  A traitor to my people, I guess you'd call me.\"\n\"I am also a traitor to my people,\" said the woman, holding up her hand which was scarred with a branded symbol. \"It means that I can never go back to my homeland.\"\n\"Well, you're not thinking of staying here, are you?\" laughed Cassyr. \"It's certainly quaint, but come wintertide, there's going to be snow up to your eyelashes.  It's no place for a new baby.  What is her name?\"\n\"Bosriel.  It means 'Beauty of the Forest.' Where are you going?\"\n\"Dwynnen, on the bay in High Rock.  You're welcome to join me, I could use the company.\" He held out his hand. \"Cassyr Whitley.\"\n\"Turala,\" said the woman after a pause.  She was going to use her family's name first, as is tradition, but she realized that it was no longer her name. \"I would love to accompany you, thank you.\"\n19 Last Seed, 2920\nAld Lambasi, Morrowind\nFive men and two women stood in the silence of the Great Room of the castle, the only sound the scrawl of quill on parchment and the gentle tapping of rain on the large picture window.  As the Prince set the seal of Cyrodiil on the document, the peace was made official.  The Duke of Mournhold broke out in a roar of delight, ordering wine brought in to commemorate the end of eighty years of war.\nOnly Sotha Sil stood apart from the group.  His face betrayed no emotion.  Those who knew him best knew he did not believe in endings or beginnings, but in the continuous cycle of which this was but a small part.\n\"My Prince,\" said the castle steward, unhappy at breaking the celebration. \"There is a messenger here from your mother, the Empress.  He asked to see your father, but as he did not arrive --\"\nJuilek excused himself and went to speak with the messenger.\n\"The Empress does not live in the Imperial City?\" asked Vivec.\n\"No,\" said Almalexia, shaking her head sadly. \"Her husband has imprisoned her in Black Marsh, fearing that she was plotting a revolution against him.  She is extremely wealthy and has powerful allies in the western Colovian estates so he could not marry another or have her executed.  They've been at an impasse for the last seventeen years since Juilek was a child.\"\nThe Prince returned a few minutes later.  His face betrayed his anxiety, though he took troubles to hide it.\n\"My mother needs me,\" he said simply. \"I'm afraid I must leave at once.  If I may have a copy of the treaty, I will bring it with me to show the Empress the good we have done today, and then I will carry it on to the Imperial City so it may be made official.\"\nPrince Juilek left with the fond farewells of the Three of Morrowind.  As they watched him ride out into the rainswept night south towards Black Marsh, Vivec said, \"Tamriel will be much healed when he has the throne.\"\n31 Last Seed, 2920\nDorsza Pass, Black Marsh\nThe moon was rising over the desolate quarry, steaming with swamp gas from a particularly hot summer as the Prince and his two guard escort rode out of the forest.  The massive piles of earth and dung had been piled high in antiquity by some primitive, long-dead tribe of Black Marsh, hoping to keep out some evil from the north.  Evidently, the evil had broken through at Dorsza Pass, the large crack in the sad, lonely rampart that stretched for miles.\nThe black twisted trees that grew on the barrier cast strange shadows down, like a net tangling.  The Prince's mind was on his mother's cryptic letter, hinting at the threat of an invasion.  He could not, of course, tell the Dunmer about it, at the very least until he knew more and had notified his father.  After all, the letter was meant for him.  It was its urgent tone that made him decide to go directly to Gideon.\nThe Empress had also warned him about a band of former slaves who attacked caravans going into Dorsza Pass.  She advised him to be certain to make his Imperial shield visible, so they would know he was not one of the hated Dunmer slavers.  Upon riding into the tall weeds that flooded through the pass like a noxious river, the Prince ordered that his shield be displayed.\n\"I can see why the slaves use this,\" said the Prince's captain. \"It's an excellent location for an ambush.\"\nJuilek nodded his head, but his thoughts were elsewhere.  What threat of invasion could the Empress have discovered?  Were the Akaviri on the seas again?  If so, how could his mother from her cell in Castle Giovese know of it?  A rustle in the weeds and a single sharp human cry behind him interrupted his ponderings.\nTurning around, the Prince discovered that he was alone.  His escort had vanished.\nThe Prince peered over the stretch of the moonlit sea of grass which waved in almost hypnotic patterns to the ebb and flow of the night wind billowing through the pass.  It was impossible to tell if a struggling soldier was beneath this system of vibrations, a dying horse behind another.  A high, whistling wind drowned out any sound the victims of the ambush might be making.\nJuilek drew his sword, and thought about what to do, his mind willing his heart not to panic.  He was closer to the exit of the pass than the entrance. Whatever had slain his escort must have been behind him.  If he rode fast enough, perhaps he could outrun it.  Spurring his horse to gallop, he charged for the hills ahead, framed by the mighty black piles of dirt.\nWhen he was thrown, it happened so suddenly, he was hurdling forward before he was truly conscious of the fact.  He landed several yards beyond where his horse had fallen, breaking his shoulder and his back on impact.  A numbness washed over him as he stared at his poor, dying steed, its belly sliced open by one of several spears jutting up just below the surface of the grass.\nPrince Juilek was not able to turn and face the figure that emerged from the grass, nor able to move to defend himself.  His throat was cut without ceremony.\nMiramor cursed when he saw the face of his victim more clearly in the moonlight.  He had seen the Emperor at the Battle of Bodrum when he had fought in His Imperial Majesty's command, and this was clearly not the Emperor.  Searching the body, he found the letter and a treaty signed by Vivec, Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and the Duke of Mournhold representing Morrowind and the Prince Juilek Cyrodiil, representing the Cyrodiil Empire.\n\"Curse my luck,\" muttered Miramor to himself and the whispering grass. \"I've only killed a Prince.  Where's the reward in that?\"\nMiramor destroyed the letter, as Zuuk had instructed him to do, and pocketed the treaty.  At the very least, such a curiosity would have some market value.  He disassembled the traps as he pondered his next step.  Return to Gideon and ask his employer for a lesser reward for killing the heir?  Move on to other lands?  At the very least, he considered, he had picked up two useful skills from the Battle of Bodrum.  From the Dunmer, he had learned the excellent spear trap.  And abandoning the Imperial army, he had learned how to skulk in the grass.\nThe Year is Continued in Hearth Fire.\n2920, Hearth Fire, Book 9\nHearth Fire\nBook Nine of 2920 \nThe Last Year of the First Era\nby\nCarlovac Townway\n2 Hearth Fire, 2920\nGideon, Black Marsh\nThe Empress Tavia lay across her bed, a hot late summer wind she could not feel banging the shutters of her cell to and fro against the iron bars.  Her throat felt like it was on fire but still she sobbed, uncontrollably, wringing her last tapestry in her hands.  Her wailing echoed throughout the hollow halls of Castle Giovese, stopping maids in their washing and guards in their conversation.  One of her women came up the narrow stairs to see her mistress, but her chief guard Zuuk stood at the doorway and shook his head.\n\"She's just heard that her son is dead,\" he said quietly.\n5 Hearth Fire, 2920\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil\n\"Your Imperial Majesty,\" said the Potentate Versidue-Shaie through the door. \"You can open the door.  I assure you, you're perfectly safe.  No one wants to kill you.\"\n\"Mara's blood!\" came the Emperor Reman III's voice, muffled, hysterical, tinged with madness. \"Someone assassinated the Prince, and he was holding my shield!  They could have thought he was me!\"\n\"You're certainly correct, your Imperial Majesty,\" replied the Potentate, expunging any mocking qualities from his voice while his black-slitted eyes rolled contemptuously. \"And we must find and punish the evildoer responsible for your son's death.  But we cannot do it without you.  You must be brave for your Empire.\"\nThere was no reply.\n\"At the very least, come out and sign the order for Lady Rijja's execution,\" called the Potentate. \"Let us dispose of the one traitor and assassin we know of.\"\nA brief pause, and then the sound of furniture scraping across the floor.  Reman opened the door just a crack, but the Potentate could see his angry, fearful face, and the terrible mound of ripped tissue that used to be his right eye.  Despite the best healers in the Empire, it was still a ghastly souvenir of the Lady Rijja's work in Thurzo Fortress.\n\"Hand me the order,\" the Emperor snarled. \"I'll sign it with pleasure.\"\n6 Hearth Fire, 2920\nGideon, Cyrodiil\nThe strange blue glow of the will o' the wisps, a combination, so she'd be told, of swamp gas and spiritual energy, had always frightened Tavia as she looked out her window.  Now it seemed strangely comforting.  Beyond the bog lay the city of Gideon.  It was funny, she thought, that she had never stepped foot in its streets, though she had watched it ever day for seventeen years.\n\"Can you think of anything I've forgotten?\" she asked, turning to look back on the loyal Kothringi Zuuk.\n\"I know exactly what to do,\" he said simply.  He seemed to smile, but the Empress realized that it was only her own face reflected in his silvery skin.  She was smiling, and she didn't even realize it.\n\"Make certain you aren't followed,\" she warned. \"I don't want my husband to know where my gold's been hiding all these years.  And do take your share of it.  You've been a good friend.\"\nThe Empress Tavia stepped forward and dropped from sight into the mists.  Zuuk replaced the bars on the tower window, and threw a blanket over some pillows on her bed.  With any luck, they would not discover her body on the lawn until morning, at which time he hoped to be halfway to Morrowind.\n9 Hearth Fire, 2920\nPhrygias, High Rock\nThe strange trees on all sides resembled knobby piles crowned with great bursts of reds, yellows, and oranges, like insect mounds caught fire.  The Wrothgarian mountains were fading into the misty afternoon.  Turala marveled at the sight, so alien, so different from Morrowind, as she plodded the horse forward into an open pasture.  Behind her, head nodding against his chest, Cassyr slept, cradling Bosriel.  For a moment, Turala considered jumping the low painted fence that crossed the field, but she thought better of it.  Let Cassyr sleep for a few more hours before giving him the reigns.\nAs the horse passed into the field, Turala saw the small green house on the next hill, half-hidden in forest.  So picturesque was the image, she felt herself lull into a pleasant half-sleeping state.  A blast of a horn brought her back to reality with a shudder.  Cassyr opened his eyes.\n\"Where are we?\" he hissed.\n\"I don't know,\" Turala stammered, wide-eyed. \"What is that sound?\"\n\"Orcs,\" he whispered. \"A hunting party.  Head for the thicket quickly.\"\nTurala trotted the horse into the small collection of trees. Cassyr handed her the child and dismounted.  He began pulling their bags off next, throwing them into the bushes.  A sound started then, a distant rumbling of footfall, growing louder and closer.  Turala climbed off carefully and helped Cassyr unburden the horse.  All the while, Bosriel watched open-eyed.  Turala sometimes worried that her baby never cried.  Now she was grateful for it.  With the last of the luggage off, Cassyr slapped the horse's rear, sending it galloping into the field.  Taking Turala's hand, he hunkered down in the bushes.\n\"With luck,\" he murmured. \"They'll think she's wild or belongs to the farm and won't go looking for the rider.\"\nAs he spoke, a horde of orcs surged into the field, blasting their horns.  Turala had seen orcs before, but never in such abundance, never with such bestial confidence.  Roaring with delight at the horse and its confused state, they hastened past the timber where Cassyr, Turala, and Bosriel hid.  The wildflowers flew into the air at their stampede, powdering the air with seeds.  Turala tried to hold back a sneeze, and thought she succeeded.  One of the orcs heard something though, and brought another with him to investigate.\nCassyr quietly unsheathed his sword, mustering all the confidence he could.  His skills, such as they were, were in spying, not combat, but he vowed to protect Turala and her babe for as long as he could.  Perhaps he would slay these two, he reasoned, but not before they cried out and brought the rest of the horde.\nSuddenly, something invisible swept through the bushes like a wind.  The orcs flew backwards, falling dead on their backs.  Turala turned and saw a wrinkled crone with bright red hair emerge from a nearby bush.\n\"I thought you were going to bring 'em right to me,\" she whispered, smiling. \"Best come with me.\"\nThe three followed the old woman through a deep crevasse of bramble bushes that ran through the field toward the house on the hill.  As they emerged on the other side, the woman turned to look at the orcs feasting on the remains of the horse, a blood-soaked orgy to the beat of multiple horns.\n\"That horse yours?\" she asked.  When Cassyr nodded, she laughed loudly. \"That's rich meat, that is.  Those monsters'll have bellyaches and flatulence in the morning.  Serves 'em right.\"\n\"Shouldn't we keep moving?\" whispered Turala, unnerved by the woman's laughter.\n\"They won't come up here,\" she grinned, looking at Bosriel who smiled back. \"They're too afraid of us.\"\nTurala turned to Cassyr, who shook his head. \"Witches.  Am I correct in assuming that this is Old Barbyn's Farm, the home of the Skeffington Coven?\"\n\"You are, pet,\" the old woman giggled girlishly, pleased to be so infamous. \"I am Mynista Skeffington.\"\n\"What did you do to those orcs?\" asked Turala. \"Back there in the thicket?\"\n\"Spirit fist right side the head,\" Mynista said, continuing the climb up the hill.  Ahead of them was the farmhouse grounds, a well, a chicken coop, a pond, women of all ages doing chores, the laughter of children at play.  The old woman turned and saw that Turala did not understand. \"Don't you have witches where you come from, child?\"\n\"None that I know of,\" she said.\n\"There are all sorts of wielders of magic in Tamriel,\" she explained. \"The Psijics study magic like its their painful duty.  The battlemages in the army on the other end of the scale hurl spells like arrows.  We witches commune and conjure and celebrate.  To fell those orcs, I merely whispered to the spirits of the air, Amaro, Pina, Tallatha, the fingers of Kynareth, and the breath of the world, with whom I have an intimate acquaintance, to smack those bastards dead.  You see, conjuration is not about might, or solving riddles, or agonizing over musty old scrolls.  It's about fostering relations.  Being friendly, you might say.\"\n\"Well, we certainly appreciate you being friendly with us,\" said Cassyr.\n\"As well you might,\" coughed Mynista. \"Your kind destroyed the orc homeland two thousand years ago.  Before that, they never came all the way up here and bothered us.  Now let's get you cleaned up and fed.\"\nWith that, Mynista led them into the farm, and Turala met the family of the Skeffington Coven.\n11 Hearth Fire, 2920\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil\nRijja had not even tried to sleep the night before, and she found the somber music played during her execution to have a soporific effect.  It was as if she was willing herself to be unconscious before the ax stroke.  Her eyes were bound so she could not see her former lover, the Emperor, seated before her, glaring with his one good eye.  She could not see the Potentate Versidue-Shaie, his coil neatly wrapped beneath him, a look of triumph in his golden face.  She could feel, numbly, the executioner's hand touch her back to steady her.  She flinched like a dreamer trying to awake.\nThe first blow caught the back of her head and she screamed.  The next hacked through her neck, and she was dead.\nThe Emperor turned to the Potentate wearily, \"Now that's done.  You said she had a pretty sister in Hammerfell named Corda?\"\n18 Hearth Fire, 2920\nDwynnen, High Rock\nThe horse the witches had sold him was not as good as his old one, Cassyr considered.  Spirit worship and sacrifice and sisterhood might be all well and good for conjuring spirits, but it tends to spoil beasts of burden.  Still, there was little to complain about.  With the Dunmer woman and her child gone, he had made excellent time.  Ahead were the walls surrounding the city of his homeland.  Almost at once, he was set upon by his old friends and family.\n\"How went the war?\" cried his cousin, running to the road. \"Is it true that Vivec signed a peace with the Prince, but the Emperor refuses to honor it?\"\n\"That's not how it was, was it?\" asked a friend, joining them. \"I heard that the Dunmer had the Prince murdered and then made up a story about a treaty, but there's no evidence for it.\"\n\"Isn't there anything interesting happening here?\" Cassyr laughed. \"I really don't have the least interest in discussing the war or Vivec.\"\n\"You missed the procession of the Lady Corda,\" said his friend. \"She came across the bay with full entourage and then east to the Imperial City.\"\n\"But that's nothing.  What was Vivec like?\" asked his cousin eagerly. \"He supposed to be a living god.\"\n\"If Sheogorath steps down and they need another God of Madness, he'll do,\" said Cassyr haughtily.\n\"And the women?\" asked the lad, who had only seen Dunmer ladies on very rare occasions.\nCassyr merely smiled.  Turala Skeffington flashed into his mind for an instant before fading away.  She would be happy with the coven, and her child would be well cared for.  But they were part of the past now, a place and a war he wanted to forget forever.  Dismounting his horse, he walked it into the city, chatting of trivial gossip of life on the Iliac Bay.\n2920, Frostfall, Book 10\nFrostfall\nBook Ten of 2920, \nThe Last Year of the First Era\nby\nCarlovac Townway\n10 Frostfall, 2920\nPhrygias, High Rock\nThe creature before them blinked, senseless, its eyes glazed, mouth opening and closing as if relearning its function. A thin glob of saliva burbled down between its fangs, and hung suspended. Turala had never seen anything of its kind before, reptilian and massive, perched on its hind legs like a man. Mynistera applauded enthusiastically.\n\"My child,\" she crowed. \"You have come so far in so short a time.  What were you thinking when you summoned this daedroth?\"\nIt took Turala a moment to recall whether she was thinking anything at all.  She was merely overwhelmed that she had reached out across the fabric of reality into the realm of Oblivion, and plucked forth this loathsome creature, conjuring it into the world by the power of her mind.\n\"I was thinking of the color red,\" Turala said, concentrating. \"The simplicity and clarity of it.  And then -- I desired, and spoke the charm.  And this is what I conjured up.\"\n\"Desire is a powerful force for a young witch,\" said Mynistera. \"And it is well matched in this instance. For this daedroth is nothing if not a simple force of the spirits.  Can you release your desire as easily?\"\nTurala closed her eyes and spoke the dismissal invocation. The monster faded away like a painting in sunlight, still blinking confusedly. Mynistera embraced her Dark Elf pupil, laughing with delight.\n\"I never would have believed it, a month and a day you've been with the coven, and you're already far more advanced than most of the women here. There is powerful blood in you, Turala, you touch spirits like you were touching a lover. You'll be leading this coven one day -- I have seen it!\"\nTurala smiled.  It was good to be complimented. The Duke of Mournhold had praised her pretty face; and her family, before she had dishonored them, praised her manners. Cassyr had been nothing more than a companion: his compliments meant nothing. But with Mynistera, she felt she was home.\n\"You'll be leading the coven for many years yet, great sister,\" said Turala.\n\"I certainly intend to. But the spirits, while marvelous companions and faultless tellers of truth, are often hazy about the when and hows. You can't blame them really. When and how mean so little to them,\" Mynistera opened the door to the shed, allowing the brisk autumn breeze in to dispel the bitter and fetid smells of the daedroth. \"Now, I need you to run an errand to Wayrest.  It's only a week's ride there, and a week's ride back. Bring Doryatha and Celephyna with you. As much as we try to be self-sufficient, there are herbs we can't grow here, and we seem to run through an enormous quantity of gems in no time at all. It's important that the people of the city learn to recognize you as one of the wise women of Skeffington coven. You'll find the benefits of being notorious far outweigh the inconveniences.\"\nTurala did as she was bade. As she and her sisters climbed aboard their horses, Mynistera brought her child, little five-month-old Bosriel to kiss her mother good-bye. The witches were in love with the little Dunmer infant, fathered by a wicked Duke, birthed by wild Ayleid elves in the forest heart of the Empire. Turala knew her nursemaids would protect her child with their lives.  After many kisses and a farewell wave, the three young witches rode off into the bright woods, under a covering of red, yellow, and orange.\n12 Frostfall, 2920\nDwynnen, High Rock\nFor a Middas evening, the Least Loved Porcupine tavern was wildly crowded. A roaring fire in the pit in the center of the room cast an almost sinister glow on all the regulars, and made the abundance of bodies look like a punishment tapestry inspired by the Arcturian Heresies. Cassyr took his usual place with his cousin and ordered a flagon of ale.\n\"Have you been to see the Baron?\" asked Palyth.\n\"Yes, he may have work for me in the palace of Urvaius,\" said Cassyr proudly. \"But more than that I can't say. You understand, secrets of state and all that. Why are there so many damned people here tonight?\"\n\"A shipload of Dark Elves just came in to harbor. They've come from the war.  I was just waiting until you got here to introduce you as another veteran.\"\nCassyr blushed, but regained his composure enough to ask: \"What are they doing here?  Has there been a truce?\"\n\"I don't know the full story,\" said Palyth. \"But apparently, the Emperor and Vivec are in negotiations again. These fellas here have investments they were keen to check on, and they figured things on the Bay were quiet enough. But the only way we can get the full story is to talk to the chaps.\"\nWith that, Palyth gripped his cousin's arm and pulled him to the other side of the bar so suddenly, Cassyr would have had to struggle violently to resist. The Dunmer travelers were spread out across four of the tables, laughing with the locals. They were largely amiable young men, well-dressed, befitting merchants, animated in gesture made more extravagant by liquor.\n\"Excuse me,\" said Palyth, intruding on the conversation. \"My shy cousin Cassyr was in the war as well, fighting for the living god, Vivec.\"\n\"The only Cassyr I ever heard of,\" said one of the Dunmer drunkenly with a wide, friendly smile, shaking Cassyr's free hand. \"Was a Cassyr Whitley, who Vivec said was the worst spy in history. We lost Ald Marak due to his bungling intelligence work.  For your sake, friend, I hope the two of you were never confused.\"\nCassyr smiled and listened as the lout told the story of his failure with bountiful exaggerations which caused the table to roar with laughter. Several eyes looked his way, but none of the locals sought to explain that the fool of the tale was standing at attention. The eyes that stung the most were his cousin's, the young man who had believed that he had returned to Dwynnen a great hero. At some point, certainly, the Baron would hear about it, his idiocy increasing manifold with each retelling.\nWith every fiber in his soul, Cassyr cursed the living god Vivec.\n21 Frostfall, 2920\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil\nCorda, in a robe of blinding whiteness, a uniform of the priestesses of the Hegathe Morwha conservatorium, arrived in the City just as the first winter storm was passing. The clouds broke with sunlight, and the beauteous teenaged Redguard girl appeared in the wide avenue with escort, riding toward the Palace. While her sister was tall, thin, angular, and haughty, Corda was a small, round-faced lass with wide brown eyes. The locals were quick to draw comparisons.\n\"Not a month after Lady Rijja's execution,\" muttered a housemaid, peering out the window, and winking to her neighbor.\n\"And not a month out of the nunnery neither,\" the other woman agreed, reveling in the scandal. \"This one's in for a ride. Her sister weren't no innocent, and look where she ended up.\"\n24 Frostfall, 2920\nDwynnen, High Rock\nCassyr stood on the harbor and watched the early sleet fall on the water. It was a pity, he thought, that he was prone to sea-sickness. There was nothing for him now in Tamriel to the east or to the west.  Vivec's tale of his poor spycraft had spread to taverns everywhere. The Baron of Dwynnen had released him from his contract.  No doubt they were laughing about him in Daggerfall, too, and Dawnstar, Lilmoth, Rimmen, Greenheart, probably in Akavir and Yokuda for that matter.  Perhaps it would be best to drop into the waves and sink. The thought, however, did not stay long in his mind: it was not despair that haunted him, but rage.  Impotent fury that he could not assuage.\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" said a voice behind him, making him jump. \"I'm sorry to disturb you, but I was wondering whether you could recommend an inexpensive tavern for me to spend the night.\"\nIt was a young man, a Nord, with a sack over his shoulder. Obviously, he had just disembarked from one of the boats. For the first time in weeks, someone was looking at Cassyr as something other than a colossal, famous idiot.  He could not help, black as his mood was, but be friendly.\n\"You've just arrived from Skyrim?\" asked Cassyr.\n\"No, sir, that's where I'm going,\" said the fellow. \"I'm working my way home. I've come up from Sentinel, and before that Stros M'kai, and before that Woodhearth in Valenwood, and before that Artaeum in Summurset. Welleg's my name.\"\nCassyr introduced himself and shook Welleg's hand. \"Did you say you came from Artaeum? Are you a Psijic?\"\n\"No, sir, not anymore,\" the fellow shrugged. \"I was expelled.\"\n\"Do you know anything about summoning daedra? You see, I want to cast a curse against a particularly powerful person, one might say a living god, and I haven't had any luck. The Baron won't allow me in his sight, but the Baroness has sympathy for me and allowed me the use of their Summoning Chambers.\" Cassyr spat. \"I did all the rituals, made sacrifices, but nothing came of it.\"\n\"That'd be because of Sotha Sil, my old master,\" replied Welleg with some bitterness. \"The Daedra princes have agreed not to be summoned by any amateurs at least until the war ends. Only the Psijics may counsel with the daedra, and a few nomadic sorcerers and witches.\"\n\"Witches, did you say?\"\n29 Frostfall, 2920\nPhrygias, High Rock\nPale sunlight flickered behind the mist bathing the forest as Turala, Doryatha, and Celephyna drove their horses on. The ground was wet with a thin layer of frost, and laden down with goods, it was a slippery way over unpaved hills. Turala tried to contain her excitement about coming back to the coven. Wayrest had been an adventure, and she adored the looks of fear and respect the cityfolk gave her.  But for the last few days, all she could think of was returning to her sisters and her child.\nA bitter wind whipped her hair forward so she could see nothing but the path ahead.  She did not hear the rider approach to her side until he was almost upon her. When she turned and saw Cassyr, she shouted with as much surprise as pleasure at meeting an old friend. His face was pale and drawn, but she took it to be merely from travel.\n\"What brings you back to Phrygias?\" she smiled. \"Were you not treated well in Dwynnen?\"\n\"Well enough,\" said Cassyr. \"I have need of the Skeffington coven.\"\n\"Ride with us,\" said Turala. \"I'll bring you to Mynistera.\"\nThe four continued on, and the witches regaled Cassyr with tales of Wayrest.  It was evident that it was also a rare treat for Doryatha and Celephyna to leave Old Barbyn's Farm. They had been born there, as daughters and grand-daughters of Skeffington witches. Ordinary High Rock city life was exotic to them as it was to Turala. Cassyr said little, but smiled and nodded his head, which was encouragement enough. Thankfully, none of the stories they had heard were about his own stupidity. Or at the very least, they did not tell him.\nDoryatha was in the midst of a tale she had heard in a tavern about a thief who had been locked overnight in a pawnshop when they crossed over a familiar hill.  Suddenly, she halted in her story. The barn was supposed to be visible, but it was not. The other three followed her gaze into the fog, and a moment later, they rode as fast as they could towards what was once the site of the Skeffington coven.\nThe fire had long since burned out. Nothing but ashes, skeletons, and broken weaponry remained. Cassyr recognized at once the signs of an orc raid.\nThe witches fell from their horses, racing through the remains, wailing. Celephyna found a tattered, bloody piece of cloth that she recognized from Mynistera's cloak.  She held it to her ashen face, sobbing. Turala screamed for Bosriel, but the only reply was the high whistling wind through the ashes.\n\"Who did this?\" she cried, tears streaking down her face. \"I swear I'll conjure up the very flames of Oblivion! What have they done with my baby?\"\n\"I know who did it,\" said Cassyr quietly, dropping from his horse and walking towards her. \"I've seen these weapons before. I fear I met the very fiends responsible in Dwynnen, but I never thought they'd find you. This is the work of assassins hired by the Duke of Mournhold.\"\nHe paused. The lie came easily. Adopt and improvise. What's more, he could tell instantly that she believed it.  Her resentment over the cruelty the Duke had shown her had quieted, but never disappeared. One look at her burning eyes told him that she would summon the daedra and wreak his, and her, revenge upon Morrowind.  And what's more, he knew they'd listen.\nAnd listen they did. For the power that is greater than desire is rage. Even rage misplaced.\n2920, Sun's Dusk, Book 11\nSun's Dusk\nBook Eleven of 2920\nThe Last Year of the First Era\nby\nCarlovac Townway\n2 Sun's Dusk, 2920\nTel Aruhn, Morrowind\n\"A man to see you, Night Mother,\" said the guard. \"A Kothringi tribesman who presents his credentials as Lord Zuuk of Black Marsh, part of the Imperial Garrison of Gideon.\"\n\"What makes you think I'd have even the slightest possible interest in seeing him?\" asked the Night Mother with venomous sweetness.\n\"He brings a letter from the late Empress of the Cyrodilic Empire.\"\n\"We are having a busy day,\" she smiled, clapping her hands together with delight. \"Show him in.\"\nZuuk entered the chamber.  His metallic skin, though exposed only at his face and hands, caught the light of the fireplace and the lightning of the stormy night from the window. The Night Mother noted also that she could see herself as he saw her: serene, beautiful, fear-inspiring.  He handed her his letter from the Empress without a word.  Sipping her wine, she read it.\n\"The Duke of Morrowind also offered me an appreciable sum to have the Emperor murdered earlier this year,\" she said, folding the letter. \"His payment sunk, and never was delivered.  It was a considerable annoyance, particularly as I had already gone to the trouble of putting one of my agents in the palace.  Why should I assume that your more-than-generous payment, from a dead woman, will arrive?\"\n\"I brought it with me,\" said Zuuk simply. \"It is in the carriage outside.\"\n\"Then bring it in and our business is complete,\" smiled the Night Mother. \"The Emperor will be dead by year's end.  You may leave the gold with Apaladith.  Unless you'd care for some wine?\"\nZuuk declined the offer and withdrew.  The moment he left the room, Miramor slipped noiselessly back from behind the dark tapestry.  The Night Mother offered him a glass of wine, and he accepted it.\n\"I know that fellow, Zuuk,\" said Miramor carefully. \"I didn't know he worked for the old Empress though.\"\n\"Let's talk about you some more, if you don't mind,\" she said, knowing he would, in fact, not mind.\n\"Let me show you my worth,\" said Miramor. \"Let me be the one to do the Emperor in.  I've already killed his son, and you saw there how well I can hide myself away.  Tell me you saw one ripple in the tapestry.\"\nThe Night Mother smiled.  Things were falling into place rather nicely.\n\"If you know how to use a dagger, you will find him at Bodrum,\" she said, and described to him what he must do.\n3 Sun's Dusk, 2920\nMournhold, Morrowind\nThe Duke stared out the window.  It was early morning, and for the fourth straight day, a red mist hung over the city, flashing lightning.  A freakish wind blew through the streets, ripping his flags from the castle battlements, forcing all his people to close their shudders tightly.  Something terrible was coming to his land.  He was not a greatly learned man, but he knew the signs.  So too did his subjects.\n\"When will my messengers reach the Three?\" he growled, turning to his castellan.\n\"Vivec is far to the north, negotiating the treaty with the Emperor,\" the man said, his face and voice trembling with fear. \"Almalexia and Sotha Sil are in Necrom.  Perhaps they can be reached in a few days time.\"\nThe Duke nodded.  He knew his messengers were fast, but so too was the hand of Oblivion.\n6 Sun's Dusk, 2920\nBodrum, Morrowind\nTorchlight caught in the misting snow gave the place an otherworldly quality.  The soldiers from both camps found themselves huddled together around the largest of the bonfires: winter bringing enemies of four score of warring close together.  While only a few of the Dunmer guard could speak Cyrodilic, they found common ground battling for warmth.  When a pretty Redguard maiden passed into their midst to warm herself before moving back to the treaty tent, many a man from both army raised their eyes in approval.\nThe Emperor Reman III was eager to leave negotiations before they had ever begun.  A month earlier, he thought it would be a sign of good will to meet at the site of his defeat to Vivec's army, but the place brought back more bad memories than he thought it would.  Despite the protestations of Potentate Versidue-Shaie that the rocks of the river were naturally red, he could swear he saw splatters of his soldier's blood.\n\"We have all the particulars of the treaty,\" he said, taking a glass of hot yuelle from his mistress Corda. \"But here and now is not the place for signing.  We should do it at the Imperial Palace, with all the pomp and splendor this historic occasion demands.  You must bring Almalexia with you too.  And that wizard fellow.\"\n\"Sotha Sil,\" whispered the Potentate.\n\"When?\" asked Vivec with infinite patience.\n\"In exactly a month's time,\" said the Emperor, smiling munificently and clambering awkwardly to his feet. \"We will hold a grand ball to commemorate.  Now I must take a walk.  My legs are all cramped up with the weather.  Corda, my dear, will you walk with me?\"\n\"Of course, your Imperial Majesty,\" she said, helping him toward the tent's entrance.\n\"Would you like me to come with you as well, your Imperial Majesty?\" asked Versidue-Shaie.\n\"Or I?\" asked King Dro'Zel of Senchal, a newly appointed advisor to the court.\n\"That won't be necessary, I won't be gone a minute,\" said Reman.\nMiramor crouched in the same rushes he had hidden in nearly eight months before.  Now the ground was hard and snow-covered, and the rushes slick with ice.  Every slight movement he made issued forth a crunch.  If it were not for the raucous songs of the combined Morrowind and Imperial army gathered about the bonfire, he would not have dared creep as close to the Emperor and his concubine.  They were standing at the curve in the frozen creek below the bluff, surrounded by trees sparkling with ice.\nCarefully, Miramor removed the dagger from its sheath.  He had slightly exaggerated his abilities with a short blade to the Night Mother.  True, he had used one to cut the throat of Prince Juilek, but the lad was not in any position to fight back at the time.  Still, how difficult could it be to stab an old man with one eye?  What sort of blade skill would such an easy assassination require?\nHis ideal moment presented itself before his eyes.  The woman saw something deeper in the woods, an icicle of an unusual shape she said, and darted off to get it.  The Emperor remained behind, laughing.  He turned to the face of the bluff to see his soldiers singing their song's refrain, his back to his assassin.  Miramor knew the moment had come.  Mindful of the sound of his footfall on the icy ground, he stepped forward and struck.  Very nearly.\nAlmost simultaneously, he was aware of a strong arm holding back his striking arm and another one punching a dagger into his throat.  He could not scream.  The Emperor, still looking up at the soldiers, never saw Miramor pulled back into the brush and a hand much more skilled than his slicing into his back, paralyzing him.\nHis blood pooling out and already crystallizing on the frozen ground, Miramor watched, dying, as the Emperor and his courtesan returned to join the camp up on the bluff.\n12 Sun's Dusk, 2920\nMournhold, Morrowind\nA gout of ever-erupting flame was all that remained of the central courtyard of Castle Mournhold, blasting skyward into the boiling clouds.  A thick, tarry smoke rolled through the streets, igniting everything that was wood or paper on fire.  Winged bat-like creatures harried the citizens from their hiding places out into the open, where they were met by the real army.  The only thing that kept all of Mournhold from burning to the ground was the wet, sputtering blood of its people.\nMehrunes Dagon smiled as he surveyed the castle crumbling.\n\"To think I nearly didn't come,\" he said aloud, his voice booming over the chaos. \"Imagine missing all this fun.\"\nHis attention was arrested by a needle-thin shaft of light piercing through his black and red shadowed sky.  He followed it to its source, two figures, a man and a woman standing on the hill above town.  The man in the white robe he recognized immediately as Sotha Sil, the sorcerer who had talked all the Princes of Oblivion into that meaningless truce.\n\"If you've come for the Duke of Mournhold, he isn't here,\" laughed Mehrunes Dagon. \"But you might find pieces of him the next time it rains.\"\n\"Daedra, we cannot kill you,\" said Almalexia, her face hard and resolute. \"But that you will soon regret.\"\nWith that, two living gods and a prince of Oblivion engaged in battle on the ruins of Mournhold.\n17 Sun's Dusk, 2920\nTel Aruhn, Morrowind\n\"Night Mother,\" said the guard. \"Correspondence from your agent in the Imperial Palace.\"\nThe Night Mother read the note carefully.  The test had been a success: Miramor had been successfully detected and slain.  The Emperor was in very unsafe hands.  The Night Mother responded immediately.\n18 Sun's Dusk, 2920\nBalmora, Morrowind\nSotha Sil, face solemn and unreadable, greeted Vivec at the grand plaza in front of his palace.  Vivec had ridden day and night after hearing about the battle in his tent in Bodrum, crossing mile after mile, cutting through the dangerous ground at Dagoth-Ur at blinding speed.  To the south, during all the course of the voyage, he could see the whirling red clouds and knew that the battle was continuing, day after day.  In Gnisis, he met a messenger from Sotha Sil, asking him to meet at Balmora.\n\"Where is Almalexia?\"\n\"Inside,\" said Sotha Sil wearily.  There was a long, ugly gash running across his jaw. \"She's gravely injured, but Mehrunes Dagon will not return from Oblivion for many a moon.\"\nAlmalexia lay on a bed of silk, tended to by Vivec's own healers.  Her face, even her lips, was gray as stone, and blood stained through the gauze of her bandages.  Vivec took her cold hand.  Almalexia's mouth moved wordlessly.  She was dreaming.\nShe was battling Mehrunes Dagon again amid a firestorm.  All around her, the blackened husk of a castle crumbled, splashing sparks into the night sky.  The Daedra's claws dug into her belly, spreading poison through her veins while Almalexia throttled him.  As she sank to the ground beside her defeated foe, she saw that the castle consumed by fire was not Castle Mournhold.  It was the Imperial Palace.\n24 Sun's Dusk, 2920\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil\nA winter gale blew over the city, splashing the windows and glass domes of the Imperial Palace.  Quivering light rays illuminated the figures within in surreal patterns.\nThe Emperor barked orders to his staff in preparations for the banquet and ball.  This was what he enjoyed best, more than battle.  King Dro'Zel was supervising the entertainment, having strong opinions on the matter.  The Emperor himself was arranging the details of the dinner.  Roast nebfish, vegetable marrow, cream soups, buttered helerac, codscrumb, tongue in aspic.  Potentate Versidue-Shaie had made a few suggestions of his own, but the tastes of the Akaviri were very peculiar.\nThe Lady Corda accompanied the Emperor to his chambers as night fell.\nThe Year is Concluded in Evening Star.\n2920, Evening Star, Book 12\nEvening Star\nBook Twelve of 2920\nThe Last Year of the First Era\nby\nCarlovac Townway\n\n1 Sun's Dusk, 2920\nBalmora, Morrowind\nThe winter morning sun glinted through the cobweb of frost on the window, and Almalexia opened her eyes.  An ancient healer mopped a wet cloth across her head, smiling with relief.  Asleep in the chair next to her bed was Vivec.  The healer rushed to a side cabinet and returned with a flagon of water.\n\"How are you feeling, goddess?\" asked the healer.\n\"Like I've been asleep for a very long time,\" said Almalexia.\n\"So you have.  Fifteen days,\" said the healer, and touched Vivec's arm. \"Master, wake up.  She speaks.\"\nVivec rose with a start, and seeing Almalexia alive and awake, his face broke into a wide grin.  He kissed her forehead, and took her hand.  At last, there was warmth again in her flesh.\nAlmalexia's peaceful repose suddenly snapped: \"Sotha Sil --\"\n\"He's alive and well,\" replied Vivec. \"Working on one of his machines again somewhere.  He would have stayed here too, but he realized he could do you more good working that peculiar sorcery of his.\"\nThe castellan appeared in the doorway. \"Sorry to interrupt you, master, but I wanted to tell you that your fastest messenger left late last night for the Imperial City.\"\n\"Messenger?\" asked Almalexia. \"Vivec, what has happened?\"\n\"I was to go and sign a truce with the Emperor on the sixth, so I sent him word that it had to be postponed.\"\n\"You can't do me any good here,\" said Almalexia, pulling herself up with effort. \"But if you don't sign that truce, you'll put Morrowind back to war, maybe for another eighty years.  If you leave today with an escort and hurry, perhaps you can get to the Imperial City only a day or two late.\"\n\"Are you certain you don't need me here?\" asked Vivec.\n\"I know that Morrowind needs you more.\"\n6 Sun's Dusk, 2920\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil\nThe Emperor Reman III sat on his throne, surveying the audience chamber.  It was a spectacular sight: silver ribbons dangled from the rafters, burning cauldrons of sweet herbs simmered in every corner, Pyandonean swallowtails sweeping through the air, singing their songs.  When the torches were lit and servants began fanning, the room would be transfigured into a shimmering fantasy land.  He could smell the kitchen already, spices and roasts.\nThe Potentate Versidue-Shaie and his son Savirien-Chorak slithered into the room, both bedecked in the headdress and jewelry of the Tsaesci.  There was no smile on their golden face, but there seldom was one.  The Emperor still greeted his trusted advisor with enthusiasm.\n\"This ought to impress those savage Dark Elves,\" he laughed. \"When are they supposed to arrive?\"\n\"A messenger's just arrived from Vivec,\" said the Potentate solemnly. \"I think it would be best if your Imperial Majesty met him alone.\"\nThe Emperor lost his laughter, but nodded to his servants to withdraw.  The door then opened and the Lady Corda walked into the room, with a parchment in her hand.  She shut the door behind her, but did not look up to meet the Emperor's face.\n\"The messenger gave his letter to my mistress?\" said Reman, incredulous, rising to take the note. \"That's a highly unorthodox way of delivering a message.\"\n\"But the message itself is very orthodox,\" said Corda, looking up into his one good eye.  With a single blinding motion, she brought the letter up under the Emperor's chin.  His eyes widened and blood poured down the blank parchment.  Blank that is, except for a small black mark, the sign of the Morag Tong.  It fell to the floor, revealing the small dagger hidden behind it, which she now twisted, severing his throat to the bone.  The Emperor collapsed to the floor, gasping soundlessly.\n\"How long do you need?\" asked Savirien-Chorak.\n\"Five minutes,\" said Corda, wiping the blood from her hands. \"If you can give me ten, though, I'll be doubly grateful.\"\n\"Very well,\" said the Potentate to Corda's back as she raced from the audience chamber.  \"She ought to have been an Akaviri, the way the girl handles a blade is truly remarkable.\"\n\"I must go and establish our alibi,\" said Savirien-Chorak, disappearing behind one of the secret passages that only the Emperor's most trusted knew about.\n\"Do you remember, close to a year ago, your Imperial Majesty,\" the Potentate smiled, looking down at the dying man. \"When you told me to remember 'You Akaviri have a lot of showy moves, but if just one of our strikes comes through, it's all over for you.'  I remembered that, you see.\"\nThe Emperor spat up blood and somehow said the word: \"Snake.\"\n\"I am a snake, your Imperial Majesty, inside and out.  But I didn't lie.  There was a messenger from Vivec.  It seems he'll be a little late in arriving,\" the Potentate shrugged before disappearing behind the secret passage. \"Don't worry yourself.  I'm sure the food won't go bad.\"\nThe Emperor of Tamriel died in a pool of his own blood in his empty audience chamber decorated for a grand ball.  He was found by his bodyguard fifteen minutes later.  Corda was nowhere to be found.\n8 Sun's Dusk, 2920\nCaer Suvio, Cyrodiil\nLord Glavius, apologizing profusely for the quality of the road through the forest, was the first emissary to greet Vivec and his escort as they arrived.  A string of burning globes decorated the leafless trees surrounding the villa, bobbing in the gentle but frigid night breeze.  From within, Vivec could smell the simple feast and a high sad melody.  It was a traditional Akaviri wintertide carol.\nVersidue-Shaie greeted Vivec at the front door.\n\"I'm glad you received the message before you got all the way to the City,\" said the Potentate, guiding his guest into the large, warm drawing room. \"We are in a difficult transition time, and for the moment, it is best not to conduct our business at the capitol.\"\n\"There is no heir?\" asked Vivec.\n\"No official one, though there are distant cousins vying for the throne.  While we sort the matter out, at least temporarily the nobles have decided that I may act in the office of my late master,\" Versidue-Shaie signaled for the servants to draw two comfortable chairs in front of the fireplace. \"Would you feel most comfortable if we signed the treaty officially right now, or would you like to eat something first?\"\n\"You intend to honor the Emperor's treaty?\"\n\"I intend to do everything as the Emperor,\" said the Potentate.\n14 Sun's Dusk, 2920\nTel Aruhn, Morrowind\nCorda, dusty from the road, flew into the Night Mother's arms.  For a moment, they stayed locked together, the Night Mother stroking her daughter's hair, kissing her forehead.  Finally, she reached into her sleeve and handed Corda a letter.\n\"What is it?\" asked Corda.\n\"A letter from the Potentate, expressing his delight at your expertise,\" replied the Night Mother. \"He's promised to send us payment, but I've already sent him back a reply.  The late Empress paid us enough for her husband's death.  Mephala would not have us be greedy beyond our needs.  You should not be paid twice for the same murder, so it is written.\"\n\"He killed Rijja, my sister,\" said Corda quietly.\n\"And so it should be that you struck the blow.\"\n\"Where will I go now?\"\n\"Whenever any of our holy workers becomes too famous to continue the crusade, we send them to an island called Vounoura.  It's not more than a month's voyage by boat, and I've arranged for a delightful estate for your sanctuary,\" the Night Mother kissed the girl's tears. \"You meet many friends there, and I know you will find peace and happiness at last, my child.\"\n19 Sun's Dusk, 2920\nMournhold, Morrowind\nAlmalexia surveyed the rebuilding of the town.  The spirit of the citizens was truly inspirational, she thought, as she walked among the skeletons of new buildings standing in the blackened, shattered remains of the old.  Even the plantlife showed a remarkable resilience.  There was life yet in the blasted remains of the comberry and roobrush shrubs that once lined the main avenue.  She could feel the pulse.  Come springtide, green would bolt through the black.\nThe Duke's heir, a lad of considerable intelligence and sturdy Dunmer courage, was coming down from the north to take his father's place.  The land would do more than survive: it would strengthen and expand.  She felt the future much more strongly than she saw the present.\nOf all the things she was most certain of, she knew that Mournhold was forever home to at least one goddess.\n22 Sun's Dusk, 2920\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil\nThe Cyrodiil line is dead,\" announced the Potentate to the crowd gathered beneath the Speaker's Balcony of the Imperial Palace.  \"But the Empire lives.  The distant relatives of our beloved Emperor have been judged unworthy of the throne by the trusted nobility who advised his Imperial Majesty throughout his long and illustrious reign.  It has been decided that as an impartial and faithful friend of Reman III, I will have the responsibility of continuing on in his name.\"\nThe Akaviri paused, allowing his words to echo and translate into the ears of the populace.  They merely stared up at him in silence.  The rain had washed through the streets of the city, but the sun, for a brief time, appeared to be offering a respite from the winter storms.\n\"I want to make it clear that I am not taking the title Emperor,\" he continued. \"I have been and will continue to be Potentate Versidue-Shaie, an alien welcomed kindly to your shores.  It will be my duty to protect my adopted homeland, and I pledge to work tirelessly at this task until someone more worthy takes the burden from me.  As my first act, I declare that in commemoration of this historical moment, beginning on the first of Morning Star, we will enter year one of the Second Era as time will be reckoned.  Thus, we mourn the loss of our Imperial family, and look forward to the future.\"\nOnly one man clapped at these words.  King Dro'Zel of Senchal truly believed that this would be the finest thing to happen to Tamriel in history.  Of course, he was quite mad.\n31 Sun's Dusk, 2920\nEbonheart, Morrowind\nIn the smoky catacombs beneath the city where Sotha Sil forged the future with his arcane clockwork apparatus, something unforeseen happened.  An oily bubble seeped from a long trusted gear and popped.  Immediately, the wizard's attention was drawn to it and to the chain that tiny action triggered.  A pipe shifted half an inch to the left.  A tread skipped.  A coil rewound itself and began spinning in a counter direction.  A piston that had been thrusting left-right, left-right, for millennia suddenly began shifting right-left.  Nothing broke, but everything changed.\n\"It cannot be fixed now,\" said the sorcerer quietly.\nHe looked up through a crick in the ceiling into the night sky.  It was midnight.  The second era, the age of chaos, had begun.\n"

    "text": "A Children's Anuad:\n\tThe Anuad Paraphrased\nThe first ones were brothers: Anu and Padomay. They came into the Void, and Time began.\nAs Anu and Padomay wandered the Void, the interplay of Light and Darkness created Nir. Both Anu and Padomay were amazed and delighted with her appearance, but she loved Anu, and Padomay retreated from them in bitterness.\nNir became pregnant, but before she gave birth, Padomay returned, professing his love for Nir. She told him that she loved only Anu, and Padomay beat her in rage. Anu returned, fought Padomay, and cast him outside Time. Nir gave birth to Creation, but died from her injuries soon after. Anu, grieving, hid himself in the sun and slept.\nMeanwhile, life sprang up on the twelve worlds of creation and flourished. After many ages, Padomay was able to return to Time. He saw Creation and hated it. He swung his sword, shattering the twelve worlds in their alignment. Anu awoke, and fought Padomay again. The long and furious battle ended with Anu the victor. He cast aside the body of his brother, who he believed was dead, and attempted to save Creation by forming the remnants of the 12 worlds into one -- Nirn, the world of Tamriel. As he was doing so, Padomay struck him through the chest with one last blow. Anu grappled with his brother and pulled them both outside of Time forever.\nThe blood of Padomay became the Daedra. The blood of Anu became the stars. The mingled blood of both became the Aedra (hence their capacity for good and evil, and their greater affinity for earthly affairs than the Daedra, who have no connection to Creation).\nOn the world of Nirn, all was chaos. The only survivors of the twelve worlds of Creation were the Ehlnofey and the Hist. The Ehlnofey are the ancestors of Mer and Men. The Hist are the trees of Argonia. Nirn originally was all land, with interspersed seas, but no oceans.\nA large fragment of the Ehlnofey world landed on Nirn relatively intact, and the Ehlnofey living there were the ancestors of the Mer. These Ehlnofey fortified their borders from the chaos outside, hid their pocket of calm, and attempted to live on as before. Other Ehlnofey arrived on Nirn scattered amid the confused jumble of the shattered worlds, wandering and finding each other over the years. Eventually, the wandering Ehlnofey found the hidden land of Old Ehlnofey, and were amazed and joyful to find their kin living amid the splendor of ages past. The wandering Ehlnofey expected to be welcomed into the peaceful realm, but the Old Ehlnofey looked on them as degenerates, fallen from their former glory. For whatever reason, war broke out, and raged across the whole of Nirn. The Old Ehlnofey retained their ancient power and knowledge, but the Wanderers were more numerous, and toughened by their long struggle to survive on Nirn. This war reshaped the face of Nirn, sinking much of the land beneath new oceans, and leaving the lands as we know them (Tamriel, Akavir, Atmora, and Yokuda). The Old Ehlnofey realm, although ruined, became Tamriel. The remnants of the Wanderers were left divided on the other 3 continents.\nOver many years, the Ehlnofey of Tamriel became:\n\t- the Mer (elves),\n\t- the Dwemer (the Deep Ones, sometimes called dwarves),\n\t- the Chimer (the Changed Ones, who later became the Dunmer),\n\t- the Dunmer (the Dark or Cursed Ones, the dark elves),\n\t- the Bosmer (the Green or Forest Ones, the wood elves), and\n\t- the Altmer (The Elder or High Ones, the high elves).\nOn the other continents, the Wandering Ehlnofey became the Men -- the Nords of Atmora, the Redguards of Yokuda, and the Tsaesci of Akavir.\nThe Hist were bystanders in the Ehlnofey war, but most of their realm was destroyed as the war passed over it. A small corner of it survived to become Black Marsh in Tamriel, but most of their realm was sunk beneath the sea.\nEventually, Men returned to Tamriel. The Nords were the first, colonizing the northern coast of Tamriel before recorded history, led by the legendary Ysgramor. The thirteenth of his line, King Harald, was the first to appear in written history. And so the Mythic Era ended."

    "text": "\nA Dance in Fire, v1\nA Dance in Fire\nChapter 1\nby\nWaughin Jarth\nScene: The Imperial City, Cyrodiil\nDate: 7 Frost Fall, 3E 397\nIt seemed as if the palace had always housed the Atrius Building Commission, the company of clerks and estate agents who authored and notarized nearly every construction of any note in the Empire.  It had stood for two hundred and fifty years, since the reign of the Emperor Magnus, a plain-fronted and austere hall on a minor but respectable plaza in the Imperial City.  Energetic and ambitious middle-class lads and ladies worked there, as well as complacent middle-aged ones like Decumus Scotti.  No one could imagine a world without the Commission, least of all Scotti.  To be accurate, he could not imagine a world without himself in the Commission.\n\"Lord Atrius is perfectly aware of your contributions,\" said the managing clerk, closing the shutter that demarcated Scotti's office behind him. \"But you know that things have been difficult.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Scotti, stiffly.\n\"Lord Vanech's men have been giving us a lot of competition lately, and we must be more efficient if we are to survive.  Unfortunately, that means releasing some of our historically best but presently underachieving senior clerks.\"\n\"I understand.  Can't be helped.\"\n\"I'm glad that you understand,\" smiled the managing clerk, smiling thinly and withdrawing. \"Please have your room cleared immediately.\"\nScotti began the task of organizing all his work to pass on to his successor.  It would probably be young Imbrallius who would take most of it on, which was as it should be, he considered philosophically.  The lad knew how to find business.  Scotti wondered idly what the fellow would do with the contracts for the new statue of St Alessia for which the Temple of the One had applied.  Probably invent a clerical error, blame it on his old predecessor Decumus Scotti, and require an additional cost to rectify.\n\"I have correspondence for Decumus Scotti of the Atrius Building Commission.\"\nScotti looked up.  A fat-faced courier had entered his office and was thrusting forth a sealed scroll.  He handed the boy a gold piece, and opened it up.  By the poor penmanship, atrocious spelling and grammar, and overall unprofessional tone, it was manifestly evident who the writer was.  Liodes Jurus, a fellow clerk some years before, who had left the Commission after being accused of unethical business practices.\n\n\"Dear Sckotti,\nI emagine you alway wondered what happened to me, and the last plase you would have expected to find me is out in the woods.  But thats exactly where I am.  Ha ha.  If your'e smart and want to make lot of extra gold for Lord Atrius (and yourself, ha ha), youll come down to Vallinwood too.  If you have'nt or have been following the politics hear lately, you may or may not know that ther's bin a war between the Boshmer and there neighbors Elswere over the past two years.  Things have only just calm down, and ther's a lot that needs to be rebuilt.\nNow Ive got more business than I can handel, but I need somone with some clout, someone representing a respected agencie to get the quill in the ink.  That somone is you, my fiend.  Come & meat me at the M'ther Paskos Tavern in Falinnesti, Vallinwood.  Ill be here 2 weeks and you wont be sorrie.\n-- Jurus\nP.S.: Bring a wagenload of timber if you can.\"\n\n\"What do you have there, Scotti?\" asked a voice.\nScotti started.  It was Imbrallius, his damnably handsome face peeking through the shutters, smiling in that way that melted the hearts of the stingiest of patrons and the roughest of stonemasons.  Scotti shoved the letter in his jacket pocket.\n\"Personal correspondence,\" he sniffed. \"I'll be cleared up here in a just a moment.\"\n\"I don't want to hurry you,\" said Imbrallius, grabbing a few sheets of blank contracts from Scotti's desk. \"I've just gone through a stack, and the junior scribes hands are all cramping up, so I thought you wouldn't miss a few.\"\nThe lad vanished.  Scotti retrieved the letter and read it again.  He thought about his life, something he rarely did.  It seemed a sea of gray with a black insurmountable wall looming.  There was only one narrow passage he could see in that wall.  Quickly, before he had a moment to reconsider it, he grabbed a dozen of the blank contracts with the shimmering gold leaf ATRIUS BUILDING COMMISSION BY APPOINTMENT OF HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY and hid them in the satchel with his personal effects.\nThe next day he began his adventure with a giddy lack of hesitation.   He arranged for a seat in a caravan bound for Valenwood, the single escorted conveyance to the southeast leaving the Imperial City that week.  He had scarcely hours to pack, but he remembered to purchase a wagonload of timber.\n\"It will be extra gold to pay for a horse to pull that,\" frowned the convoy head.\n\"So I anticipated,\" smiled Scotti with his best Imbrallius grin.\nTen wagons in all set off that afternoon through the familiar Cyrodilic countryside.  Past fields of wildflowers, gently rolling woodlands, friendly hamlets.  The clop of the horses' hooves against the sound stone road reminded Scotti that the Atrius Building Commission constructed it.  Five of the eighteen necessary contracts for its completion were drafted by his own hand.\n\"Very smart of you to bring that wood along,\" said a gray-whiskered Breton man next to him on his wagon. \"You must be in Commerce.\"\n\"Of a sort,\" said Scotti, in a way he hoped was mysterious, before introducing himself: \"Decumus Scotti.\"\n\"Gryf Mallon,\" said the man.  \"I'm a poet, actually a translator of old Bosmer literature.  I was researching some newly discovered tracts of the Mnoriad Pley Bar two years ago when the war broke out and I had to leave.  You are no doubt familiar with the Mnoriad, if you're aware of the Green Pact.\"\nScotti thought the man might be speaking perfect gibberish, but he nodded his head.\n\"Naturally, I don't pretend that the Mnoriad is as renowned as the Meh Ayleidion, or as ancient as the Dansir Gol, but I think it has a remarkable significance to understanding the nature of the merelithic Bosmer mind.  The origin of the Wood Elf aversion to cutting their own wood or eating any plant material at all, yet paradoxically their willingness to import plantstuff from other cultures, I feel can be linked to a passage in the Mnoriad,\" Mallon shuffled through some of his papers, searching for the appropriate text.\nTo Scotti's vast relief, the carriage soon stopped to camp for the night.  They were high on a bluff over a gray stream, and before them was the great valley of Valenwood.  Only the cry of seabirds declared the presence of the ocean to the bay to the west: here the timber was so tall and wide, twisting around itself like an impossible knot begun eons ago, to be impenetrable.  A few more modest trees, only fifty feet to the lowest branches, stood on the cliff at the edge of camp.   The sight was so alien to Scotti and he found himself so anxious about the proposition of entering the wilderness that he could not imagine sleeping.\nFortunately, Mallon had supposed he had found another academic with a passion for the riddles of ancient cultures.  Long into the night, he recited Bosmer verse in the original and in his own translation, sobbing and bellowing and whispering wherever appropriate.  Gradually, Scotti began to feel drowsy, but a sudden crack of wood snapping made him sit straight up.\n\"What was that?\"\nMallon smiled: \"I like it too. 'Convocation in the malignity of the moonless speculum, a dance of fire --'\"\n\"There are some enormous birds up in the trees moving around,\" whispered Scotti, pointing in the direction of the dark shapes above.\n\"I wouldn't worry about that,\" said Mallon, irritated with his audience. \"Now listen to how the poet characterizes Herma-Mora's invocation in the eighteenth stanza of the fourth book.\"\nThe dark shapes in the trees were some of them perched like birds, others slithered like snakes, and still others stood up straight like men.  As Mallon recited his verse, Scotti watched the figures softly leap from branch to branch, half-gliding across impossible distances for anything without wings.  They gathered in groups and then reorganized until they had spread to every tree around the camp.  Suddenly they plummeted from the heights.\n\"Mara!\" cried Scotti. \"They're falling like rain!\"\n\"Probably seed pods,\" Mallon shrugged, not turning around. \"Some of the trees have remarkable --\"\nThe camp erupted into chaos.  Fires burst out in the wagons, the horses wailed from mortal blows, casks of wine, fresh water, and liquor gushed their contents to the ground.  A nimble shadow dashed past Scotti and Mallon, gathering sacks of grain and gold with impossible agility and grace.  Scotti had only one glance at it, lit up by a sudden nearby burst of flame.  It was a sleek creature with pointed ears, wide yellow eyes, mottled pied fur and a tail like a whip.\n\"Werewolf,\" he whimpered, shrinking back.\n\"Cathay-raht,\" groaned Mallon. \"Much worse.  Khajiti cousins or some such thing, come to plunder.\"\n\"Are you sure?\"\nAs quickly as they struck, the creatures retreated, diving off the bluff before the battlemage and knight, the caravan's escorts, had fully opened their eyes.  Mallon and Scotti ran to the precipice and saw a hundred feet below the tiny figures dash out of the water, shake themselves, and disappear into the wood.\n\"Werewolves aren't acrobats like that,\" said Mallon. \"They were definitely Cathay-raht.  Bastard thieves.  Thank Stendarr they didn't realize the value of my notebooks.  It wasn't a complete loss.\"\nA Dance in Fire, v2\nA Dance in Fire\nChapter 2\n\nby\nWaughin Jarth\n\nIt was a complete loss. The Cathay-Raht had stolen or destroyed almost every item of value in the caravan in just a few minutes' time. Decumus Scotti's wagonload of wood he had hoped to trade with the Bosmer had been set on fire and then toppled off the bluff.  His clothing and contracts were tattered and ground into the mud of dirt mixed with spilt wine. All the pilgrims, merchants, and adventurers in the group moaned and wept as they gathered the remnants of their belongings by the rising sun of the dawn.\n\"I best not tell anyone that I managed to hold onto my notes for my translation of the Mnoriad Pley Bar,\" whispered the poet Gryf Mallon.\"They'd probably turn on me.\"\nScotti politely declined the opportunity of telling Mallon just how little value he himself placed on the man's property. Instead, he counted the coins in his purse.  Thirty-four gold pieces. Very little indeed for an entrepreneur beginning a new business.\n\"Hoy!\" came a cry from the wood. A small party of Bosmer emerged from the thicket, clad in leather mail and bearing arms. \"Friend or foe?\"\n\"Neither,\" growled the convoy head.\n\"You must be the Cyrodiils,\" laughed the leader of the group, a tall skeleton-thin youth with a sharp vulpine face. \"We heard you were en route. Evidently, so did our enemies.\"\n\"I thought the war was over,\" muttered one of the caravan's now ruined merchants.\nThe Bosmer laughed again: \"No act of war. Just a little border enterprise. You are going on to Falinesti?\"\n\"I'm not,\" the convoy head shook his head. \"As far as I'm concerned, my duty is done. No more horses, no more caravan. Just a fat profit loss to me.\"\nThe men and women crowded around the man, protesting, threatening, begging, but he refused to step foot in Valenwood. If these were the new times of peace, he said, he'd rather come back for the next war.\nScotti tried a different route and approached the Bosmer. He spoke with an authoritative but friendly voice, the kind he used in negotiations with peevish carpenters: \"I don't suppose you'd consider escorting me to Falinesti. I'm a representative for an important Imperial agency, the Atrius Building Commission, here to help repair and alleviate some of the problems the war with the Khajiit brought to your province.  Patriotism --\"\n\"Twenty gold pieces, and you must carry your own gear if you have any left,\" replied the Bosmer.\nScotti reflected that negotiations with peevish carpenters rarely went his way either.\nSix eager people had enough gold on them for payment. Among those without funds was the poet, who appealed to Scotti for assistance.\n\"I'm sorry, Gryf, I only have fourteen gold left over. Not even enough for a decent room when I get to Falinesti. I really would help you if I could,\" said Scotti, persuading himself that it was true.\nThe band of six and their Bosmer escorts began the descent down a rocky path along the bluff. Within an hour's time, they were deep in the jungles of Valenwood.  A never-ending canopy of hues of browns and greens obscured the sky. A millennia's worth of fallen leaves formed a deep, wormy sea of putrefaction beneath their feet. Several miles were crossed wading through the slime.  For several more, they took a labyrinthian path across fallen branches and the low-hanging boughs of giant trees.\nAll the while, hour after hour, the inexhaustible Bosmer host moved so fast, the Cyrodiils struggled to keep from being left behind. A red-faced little merchant with short legs took a bad step on a rotten branch and nearly fell. His fellow provincials had to help him up. The Bosmer paused only a moment, their eyes continually darting to the shadows in the trees above before moving on at their usual expeditious pace.\n\"What are they so nervous about?\" wheezed the merchant irritably. \"More Cathay-Raht?\"\n\"Don't be ridiculous,\" laughed the Bosmer unconvincingly. \"Khajiit this far into Valenwood? In times of peace? They'd never dare.\"\nWhen the group passed high enough above the swamp that the smell was somewhat dissipated, Scotti felt a sudden pang of hunger. He was used to four meals a day in the Cyrodilic custom. Hours of nonstop exertion without food was not part of his regimen as a comfortably paid clerk. He pondered, feeling somewhat delirious, how long they had been trotting through the jungle. Twelve hours?  Twenty? A week? Time was meaningless. Sunlight was only sporadic through the vegetative ceiling. Phosphorescent molds on the trees and in the muck below provided the only regular illumination.\n\"Is it at all possible for us to rest and eat?\" he hollered to his host up ahead.\n\"We're near to Falinesti,\" came the echoing reply. \"Lots of food there.\"\nThe path continued upward for several hours more across a clot of fallen logs, rising up to the first and then the second boughs of the tree line. As they rounded a long corner, the travelers found themselves midway up a waterfall that fell a hundred feet or more. No one had the energy to complain as they began pulling up the stacks of rock, agonizing foot by foot. The Bosmer escorts disappeared into the mist, but Scotti kept climbing until there was no more rock left. He wiped the sweat and river water from his eyes.\nFalinesti spread across the horizon before him. Sprawling across both banks of the river stood the mighty graht-oak city, with groves and orchards of lesser trees crowding it like supplicants before their king. At a lesser scale, the tree that formed the moving city would have been extraordinary: gnarled and twisted with a gorgeous crown of gold and green, dripping with vines and shining with sap. At a mile tall and half as wide, it was the most magnificent thing Scotti had ever seen. If he had not been a starving man with the soul of a clerk, he would have sung.\n\"There you are,\" said the leader of the escorts. \"Not too far a walk. You should be glad it's wintertide. In summertide, the city's on the far south end of the province.\"\nScotti was lost as to how to proceed. The sight of the vertical metropolis where people moved about like ants disoriented all his sensibilities.\n\"You wouldn't know of an inn called,\" he paused for a moment, and then pulled Jurus's letter from his pocket. \"Something like 'Mother Paskos Tavern'?\"\n\"Mother Pascost?\" the lead Bosmer laughed his familiar contemptuous laugh. \"You won't want to stay there? Visitors always prefer the Aysia Hall in the top boughs.  It's expensive, but very nice.\"\n\"I'm meeting someone at Mother Pascost's Tavern.\"\n\"If you've made up your mind to go, take a lift to Havel Slump and ask for directions there. Just don't get lost and fall asleep in the western cross.\"\nThis apparently struck the youth's friends as a very witty jest, and so it was with their laughter echoing behind him that Scotti crossed the writhing root system to the base of Falinesti. The ground was littered with leaves and refuse, and from moment to moment a glass or a bone would plummet from far above, so he walked with his neck crooked to have warning. An intricate network of platforms anchored to thick vines slipped up and down the slick trunk of the city with perfect grace, manned by operators with arms as thick as an ox's belly. Scotti approaches the nearest fellow at one of the platforms, who was idly smoking from a glass pipe.\n\"I was wondering if you might take me to Havel Slump.\"\nThe mer nodded and within a few minutes time, Scotti was two hundred feet in the air at a crook between two mighty branches. Curled webs of moss stretched unevenly across the fork, forming a sharing roof for several dozen small buildings.  There were only a few souls in the alley, but around the bend ahead, he could hear the sound of music and people. Scotti tipped the Falinesti Platform Ferryman a gold piece and asked for the location of Mother Pascost's Tavern.\n\"Straight ahead of you, sir, but you won't find anyone there,\" the Ferryman explained, pointing in the direction of the noise. \"Morndas everyone in Havel Slump has revelry.\"\nScotti walked carefully along the narrow street. Though the ground felt as solid as the marble avenues of the Imperial City, there were slick cracks in the bark that exposed fatal drops into the river. He took a moment to sit down, to rest and get used to the view from the heights. It was a beautiful day for certain, but it took Scotti only a few minutes of contemplation to rise up in alarm. A jolly little raft anchored down stream below him had distinctly moved several inches while he watched it.  But it hadn't moved at all. He had. Together with everything around him. It was no metaphor: the city of Falinesti walked. And, considering its size, it moved quickly.\nScotti rose to his feet and into a cloud of smoke that drifted out from around the bend. It was the most delicious roast he had ever smelled. The clerk forgot his fear and ran.\nThe \"revelry\" as the Ferryman had termed it took place on an enormous platform tied to the tree, wide enough to be a plaza in any other city. A fantastic assortment of the most amazing people Scotti had ever seen were jammed shoulder-to-shoulder together, many eating, many more drinking, and some dancing to a lutist and singer perched on an offshoot above the crowd.  They were largely Bosmer, true natives clad in colorful leather and bones, with a close minority of orcs.  Whirling through the throng, dancing and bellowing at one another were a hideous ape people. A few heads bobbing over the tops of the crowd belonged not, as Scotti first assumed, to very tall people, but to a family of centaurs.\n\"Care for some mutton?\" queried a wizened old mer who roasted an enormous beast on some red-hot rocks.\nScotti quickly paid him a gold piece and devoured the leg he was given.  And then another gold piece and another leg. The fellow chuckled when Scotti began choking on a piece of gristle, and handed him a mug of a frothing white drink. He drank it and felt a quiver run through his body as if he were being tickled.\n\"What is that?\" Scotti asked.\n\"Jagga. Fermented pig's milk. I can let you have a flagon of it and a bit more mutton for another gold.\"\nScotti agreed, paid, gobbled down the meat, and took the flagon with him as he slipped into the crowd.  His co-worker Liodes Jurus, the man who had told him to come to Valenwood, was nowhere to be seen. When the flagon was a quarter empty, Scotti stopped looking for Jurus.  When it was half empty, he was dancing with the group, oblivious to the broken planks and gaps in the fencework.  At three quarters empty, he was trading jokes with a group of creatures whose language was completely alien to him. By the time the flagon was completely drained, he was asleep, snoring, while the revelry continued on all around his supine body.\nThe next morning, still asleep, Scotti had the sensation of someone kissing him.  He made a face to return the favor, but a pain like fire spread through his chest and forced him to open his eyes. There was an insect the size of a large calf sitting on him, crushing him, its spiky legs holding him down while a central spiral-bladed vortex of a mouth tore through his shirt. He screamed and thrashed but the beast was too strong. It had found its meal and it was going to finish it.\nIt's over, thought Scotti wildly, I should have never left home. I could have stayed in the City, and perhaps found work with Lord Vanech. I could have begun again as a junior clerk and worked my way back up.\nSuddenly the mouth released itself. The creature shivered once, expelled a burst of yellow bile, and died.\n\"Got one!\" cried a voice, not too distantly.\nFor a moment, Scotti lay still. His head throbbed and his chest burned. Out of the corner of his eye he saw movement. Another of the horrible monsters was scurried towards him. He scrambled, trying to push himself free, but before he could come out, there was a sound of a bow cracking and an arrow pierced the second insect.\n\"Good shot!\" cried another voice. \"Get the first one again! I just saw it move a little!\"\nThis time, Scotti felt the impact of the bolt hit the carcass. He cried out, but he could hear how muffled his voice was by the beetle's body. Cautiously, he tried sliding a foot out and rolling under, but the movement apparently had the effect of convincing the archers that the creature still lived. A volley of arrows was launched forth. Now the beast was sufficiently perforated so pools of its blood, and likely the blood of its victims, began to seep out onto Scotti's body.\nWhen Scotti was a lad, before he grew too sophisticated for such sports, he had often gone to the Imperial Arena for the competitions of war. He recalled a great veteran of the fights, when asked, telling him his secret, \"Whenever I'm in doubt of what to do, and I have a shield, I stay behind it.\"\nScotti followed that advice. After an hour, when he no longer heard arrows being fired, he threw aside the remains of the bug and leapt as quickly as he could to a stand. It was not a moment too soon. A gang of eight archers had their bows pointing his direction, ready to fire. When they saw him, they laughed.\n\"Didn't anyone ever tell you not to sleep in the western cross? How're we going to exterminate all the hoarvors if you drunks keep feeding 'em?\"\nScotti shook his head and walked back along the platform, round the bend, to Havel Slump. He was bloodied and torn and tired and he had far too much fermented pig's milk. All he wanted was a proper place to lie down. He stepped into Mother Pascost's Tavern, a dank place, wet with sap, smelling of mildew.\n\"My name is Decumus Scotti,\" he said. \"I was hoping you have someone named Jurus staying here.\"\n\"Decumus Scotti?\" pondered the fleshy proprietress, Mother Pascost herself. \"I've heard that name. Oh, you must be the fellow he left the note for. Let me go see if I can find it.\"\nA Dance in Fire, v3\nA Dance in Fire\nChapter 3\nby\nWaughin Jarth\nMother Pascost disappeared into the sordid hole that was her tavern, and emerged a moment later with a scrap of paper with Liodes Jurus's familiar scrawl.  Decumus Scotti held it up before a patch of sunlight that had found its way through the massive boughs of the tree city, and read.\n\nSckotti,\nSo you made it to Falinnesti, Vallinwood!  Congradulatens!  Im sure you had quit a adventure getting here.  Unfortonitly,  Im not here anymore as you probaby guess.  Theres a town down rivver called Athie Im at.  Git a bote and join me!  Its ideal!  I hope you brot a lot of contracks, cause these peple need a lot of building done.  They wer close to the war, you see, but not so close they dont have any mony left to pay.  Ha ha.  Meat me down here as son as you can.\nJurus\n\nSo, Scotti pondered, Jurus had left Falinesti and gone to some place called Athie.  Given his poor penmanship and ghastly spelling, it could equally well be Athy, Aphy, Othry, Imthri, Urtha, or Krakamaka.  The sensible thing to do, Scotti knew, was to call this adventure over and try to find some way to get back home to the Imperial City.  He was no mercenary devoted to a life of thrills: he was, or at least had been, a senior clerk at a successful private building commission.  Over the last few weeks, he had been robbed by the Cathay-Raht, taken on a death march through the jungle by a gang of giggling Bosmeri, half-starved to death, drugged with fermented pig's milk, nearly slain by some kind of giant tick, and attacked by archers.  He was filthy, exhausted, and had, he counted, ten gold pieces to his name.  Now the man whose proposal brought him to the depths of misery was not even there.  It was both judicious and seemly to abandon the enterprise entirely.\nAnd yet, a small but distinct voice in his head told him: You have been chosen.  You have no other choice but to see this through.\nScotti turned to the stout old woman, Mother Pascost, who had been watching him curiously: \"I was wondering if you knew of a village that was at the edge of the recent conflict with Elsweyr.  It's called something like Ath-ie?\"\n\"You must mean Athay,\" she grinned. \"My middle lad, Viglil, he manages a dairy down there.  Beautiful country, right on the river.  Is that where your friend went?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Scotti. \"Do you know the fastest way to get there?\"\nAfter a short conversation, an even shorter ride to Falinesti's roots by way of the platforms, and a jog to the river bank, Scotti was negotiating transport with a huge fair-haired Bosmer with a face like a pickled carp.  He called himself Captain Balfix, but even Scotti with his sheltered life could recognize him for what he was.  A retired pirate for hire, a smuggler for certain, and probably much worse.  His ship, which had clearly been stolen in the distant past, was a bent old Imperial sloop.\n\"Fifty gold and we'll be in Athay in two days time,\" boomed Captain Balfix expansively.\n\"I have ten, no, sorry, nine gold pieces,\" replied Scotti, and feeling the need for explanation, added, \"I had ten, but I gave one to the Platform Ferryman to get me down here.\"\n\"Nine is just as fine,\" said the captain agreeably. \"Truth be told, I was going to Athay whether you paid me or not.  Make yourself comfortable on the boat, we'll be leaving in just a few minutes.\"\nDecumus Scotti boarded the vessel, which sat low in the water of the river, stacked high with crates and sacks that spilled out of the hold and galley and onto the deck.  Each was marked with stamps advertising the most innocuous substances: copper scraps, lard, ink, High Rock meal (marked \"For Cattle\"), tar, fish jelly.  Scotti's imagination reeled picturing what sorts of illicit imports were truly aboard.\nIt took more than those few minutes for Captain Balfix to haul in the rest of his cargo, but in an hour, the anchor was up and they were sailing downriver towards Athay.  The green gray water barely rippled, only touched by the fingers of the breeze.  Lush plant life crowded the banks, obscuring from sight all the animals that sang and roared at one another.  Lulled by the serene surroundings, Scotti drifted to sleep.\nAt night, he awoke and gratefully accepted some clean clothes and food from Captain Balfix.\n\"Why are you going to Athay, if I may ask?\" queried the Bosmer.\n\"I'm meeting a former colleague there.  He asked me to come down from the Imperial City where I worked for the Atrius Building Commission to negotiate some contracts,\" Scotti took another bite of the dried sausages they were sharing for dinner. \"We're going to try to repair and refurbish whatever bridges, roads, and other structures that got damaged in the recent war with the Khajiiti.\"\n\"It's been a hard two years,\" the captain nodded his head. \"Though I suppose good for me and the likes of you and your friend.  Trade routes cut off.   Now they think there's going to be war with the Summurset Isles, you heard that?\"\nScotti shook his head.\n\"I've done my share of smuggling skooma down the coast, even helping some revolutionary types escape the Mane's wrath, but now the wars've made me a legitimate trader, a business-man.  The first casualties of war is always the corrupted.\"\nScotti said he was sorry to hear that, and they lapsed into silence, watching the stars and moons' reflection on the still water.   The next day, Scotti awoke to find the captain wrapped up in his sail, torpid from alcohol, singing in a low, slurred voice.  When he saw Scotti rise, he offered his flagon of jagga.\n\"I learned my lesson during revelry at western cross.\"\nThe captain laughed, and then burst into tears, \"I don't want to be legitimate.  Other pirates I used to know are still raping and stealing and smuggling and selling nice folk like you into slavery.  I swear to you, I never thought the first time that I ran a real shipment of legal goods that my life would turn out like this.  Oh, I know, I could go back to it, but Baan Dar knows not after all I've seen.  I'm a ruined man.\"\nScotti helped the weeping mer out of the sail, murmuring words of reassurance.  Then he added, \"Forgive me for changing the subject, but where are we?\"\n\"Oh,\" moaned Captain Balfix miserably. \"We made good time.  Athay's right around the bend in the river.\"\n\"Then it looks like Athay's on fire,\" said Scotti, pointing.\nA great plume of smoke black as pitch was rising above the trees.  As they drifted around the bend, they next saw the flames, and then the blackened skeletal remains of the village.  Dying, blazing villagers leapt from rocks into the river.  A cacophony of wailing met their ears, and they could see, roaming along the edges of the town, the figures of Khajiiti soldiers bearing torches.\n\"Baan Dar bless me!\" slurred the captain. \"The war's back on!\"\n\"Oh, no,\" whimpered Scotti.\nThe sloop drifted with the current toward the opposite shore away from the fiery town.  Scotti turned his attention there, and the sanctuary it offered.  Just a peaceful arbor, away from the horror.  There was a shudder of leaves in two of the trees and a dozen lithe Khajiit dropped to the ground, armed with bows.\n\"They see us,\" hissed Scotti. \"And they've got bows!\"\n\"Well, of course they have bows,\" snarled Captain Balfix. \"We Bosmer may have invented the bloody things, but we didn't think to keep them secret, you bloody bureaucrat.\"\n\"Now, they're setting their arrows on fire!\"\n\"Yes, they do that sometimes.\"\n\"Captain, they're shooting at us!  They're shooting at us with flaming arrows!\"\n\"Ah, so they are,\" the captain agreed. \"The aim here is to avoid being hit.\"\nBut hit they were, and very shortly thereafter.  Even worse, the second volley of arrows hit the supply of pitch, which ignited in a tremendous blue blaze.  Scotti grabbed Captain Balfix and they leapt overboard just before the ship and all its cargo disintegrated.  The shock of the cold water brought the Bosmer into temporary sobriety.  He called to Scotti, who was already swimming as fast as he could toward the bend.\n\"Master Decumus, where do you think you're swimming to?\"\n\"Back to Falinesti!\" cried Scotti.\n\"It will take you days, and by the time you get there, everyone will know about the attack on Athay!  They'll never let anyone they don't know in!  The closest village downriver is Grenos, maybe they'll give us shelter!\"\nScotti swam back to the captain and side-by-side they began paddling in the middle of the river, past the burning residuum of the village.  He thanked Mara that he had learned to swim.  Many a Cyrodiil did not, as largely land-locked as the Imperial Province was.  Had he been raised in Mir Corrup or Artemon, he might have been doomed, but the Imperial City itself was encircled by water, and every lad and lass there knew how to cross without a boat.  Even those who grew up to be clerks and not adventurers.\nCaptain Balfix's sobriety faded as he grew used to the water's temperature.  Even in wintertide, the Xylo River was fairly temperate and after a fashion, even comfortable.  The Bosmer's strokes were uneven, and he'd stray closer to Scotti and then further away, pushing ahead and then falling behind.\nScotti looked to the shore to his right: the flames had caught the trees like tinder.  Behind them was an inferno, with which they were barely keeping pace.  To the shore on their left, all looked fair, until he saw a tremble in the river-reeds, and then what caused it.  A pride of the largest cats he had ever seen.  They were auburn-haired, green-eyed beasts with jaws and teeth to match his wildest nightmares.  And they were watching the two swimmers, and keeping pace.\n\"Captain Balfix, we can't go to either that shore or the other one, or we'll be parboiled or eaten,\" Scotti whispered. \"Try to even your kicking and your strokes.  Breath like you would normally.  If you're feeling tired, tell me, and we'll float on our backs for a while.\"\nAnyone who has had the experience of giving rational advice to a drunkard would understand the hopelessness.  Scotti kept pace with the captain, slowing himself, quickening, drifting left and right, while the Bosmer moaned old ditties from his pirate days.  When he wasn't watching his companion, he watched the cats on the shore.  After a stretch, he turned to his right.  Another village had caught fire.  Undoubtedly, it was Grenos.  Scotti stared at the blazing fury, awed by the sight of the destruction, and did not hear that the captain had ceased to sing.\nWhen he turned back, Captain Balfix was gone.\nScotti dove into the murky depths of the river over and over again.  There was nothing to be done.  When he surfaced after his final search, he saw that the giant cats had moved on, perhaps assuming that he too had drowned.  He continued his lonely swim downriver.  A tributary, he noted, had formed a final barrier, keeping the flames from spreading further.  But there were no more towns.  After several hours, he began to ponder the wisdom of going ashore.  Which shore was the question.\nHe was spared the decision.  Ahead of him was a rocky island with a bonfire.  He did not know if he were intruding on a party of Bosmeri or Khajiiti, only that he could swim no more.  With straining, aching muscles, he pulled himself onto the rocks.\nThey were Bosmer refugees he gathered, even before they told him.  Roasting over the fire was the remains of one of the giant cats that had been stalking him through the jungle on the opposite shore.\n\"Senche-Tiger,\" said one of the young warriors ravenously. \"It's no animal -- it's as smart as any Cathay-Raht or Ohmes or any other bleeding Khajiiti.  Pity this one drowned.  I would have gladly killed it.  You'll like the meat, though.  Sweet, from all the sugar these asses eat.\"\nScotti did not know if he was capable of eating a creature as intelligent as a man or mer, but he surprised himself, as he had done several times over the last days.  It was rich, succulent, and sweet, like sugared pork, but no seasonings had been added.  He surveyed the crowd as he ate.  A sad lot, some still weeping for lost family members.  They were the survivors of both the villages of Grenos and Athay, and war was on every person's lips.  Why had the Khajiiti attacked again?  Why -- specifically directed at Scotti, as a Cyrodiil -- why was the Emperor not enforcing peace in his provinces?\n\"I was to meet another Cyrodiil,\" he said to a Bosmer maiden who he understood to be from Athay. \"His name was Liodes Jurus.  I don't suppose you know what might have happened to him.\"\n\"I don't know your friend, but there were many Cyrodiils in Athay when the fire came,\" said the girl. \"Some of them, I think, left quickly.  They were going to Vindisi, inland, in the jungle.  I am going there tomorrow, so are many of us.  If you wish, you may come as well.\"\nDecumus Scotti nodded solemnly.  He made himself as comfortable as he could in the stony ground of the river island, and somehow, after much effort, he fell asleep.  But he did not sleep well.\nA Dance in Fire, v4\nA Dance in Fire\nChapter 4\nby\nWaughin Jarth\n\nEighteen Bosmeri and one Cyrodilic former senior clerk for an Imperial building commission trudged through the jungle westward from the Xylo River to the ancient village of Vindisi.  For Decumus Scotti, the jungle was hostile, unfamiliar ground. The enormous vermiculated trees filled the bright morning with darkness, and resembled nothing so much as grasping claws, bent on impeding their progress. Even the fronds of the low plants quivered with malevolent energy. What was worse, he was not alone in his anxiety. His fellow travelers, the natives who had survived the Khajiit attacks on the villages of Grenos and Athay, wore faces of undisguised fear.\nThere was something sentient in the jungle, and not merely the mad but benevolent indigenous spirits. In his peripheral vision, Scotti could see the shadows of the Khajiiti following the refugees, leaping from tree to tree. When he turned to face them, the lithe forms vanished into the gloom as if they had never been there. But he knew he had seen them. And the Bosmeri saw them too, and quickened their pace.\nAfter eighteen hours, bitten raw by insects, scratched by a thousand thorns, they emerged into a valley clearing. It was night, but a row of blazing torches greeted them, illuminating the leather-wrought tents and jumbled stones of the hamlet of Vindisi. At the end of the valley, the torches marked a sacred site, a gnarled bower of trees pressed closed together to form a temple. Wordlessly, the Bosmeri walked the torch arcade toward the trees. Scotti followed them. When they reached the solid mass of living wood with only one gaping portal, Scotti could see a dim blue light glowing within. A low sonorous moan from a hundred voices echoed within. The Bosmeri maiden he had been following held out her hand, stopping him.\n\"You do not understand, but no outsider, not even a friend may enter,\" she said. \"This is a holy place.\"\nScotti nodded, and watched the refugees march into the temple, heads bowed. Their voices joined with the ones within. When the last wood elf had gone inside, Scotti turned his attention back to the village. There must be food to be had somewhere. A tendril of smoke and a faint whiff of roasting venison beyond the torchlight led him.\nThey were five Cyrodiils, two Bretons, and a Nord, the group gathered around a campfire of glowing white stones, pulling steaming strips of meat from the cadaver of a great stag. At Scotti's approach, they rose up, all but the Nord who was distracted by his hunk of animal flesh.\n\"Good evening, sorry to interrupt, but I was wondering if I might have a little something to eat. I'm afraid I'm rather hungry, after walking all day with some refugees from Grenos and Athay.\"\nThey bade him to sit down and eat, and introduced themselves.\n\"So the war's back on, it seems,\" said Scotti amiably.\n\"Best thing for these effete do-nothings,\" replied the Nord in between bites. \"I've never seen such a lazy culture. Now they've got the Khajiiti striking them on land, and the high elves at sea. If there's any province that deserves a little distress, it's damnable Valenwood.\"\n\"I don't see how they're so offensive to you,\" laughed one of the Bretons.\n\"They're congenital thieves, even worse than the Khajiiti because they are so blessed meek in their aggression,\" the Nord spat out a gob of fat which sizzled on the hot stones of the fire. \"They spread their forests into territory that doesn't belong to them, slowly infiltrating their neighbors, and they're puzzled when Elsweyr shoves back at them. They're all villains of the worst order.\"\n\"What are you doing here?\" asked Scotti.\n\"I'm a diplomat from the court of Jehenna,\" muttered the Nord, returning to his food.\n\"What about you, what are you doing here?\" asked one of the Cyrodiils.\n\"I work for Lord Atrius's building commission in the Imperial City,\" said Scotti. \"One of my former colleagues suggested that I come down to Valenwood. He said the war was over, and I could contract a great deal of business for my firm rebuilding what was lost. One disaster after another, and I've lost all my money, I'm in the middle of a rekindling of war, and I cannot find my former colleague.\"\n\"Your former colleague,\" murmured another of the Cyrodiils, who had introduced himself as Reglius. \"He wasn't by any chance named Liodes Jurus, was he?\"\n\"You know him?\"\n\"He lured me down to Valenwood in nearly the exact same circumstances,\" smiled Reglius, grimly. \"I worked for your employer's competitor, Lord Vanech's men, where Liodes Jurus also formerly worked. He wrote to me, asking that I represent an Imperial building commission and contract some post-war construction.  I had just been released from my employment, and I thought that if I brought some new business, I could have my job back. Jurus and I met in Athay, and he said he was going to arrange a very lucrative meeting with the Silvenar.\"\nScotti was stunned: \"Where is he now?\"\n\"I'm no theologian, so I couldn't say,\" Reglius shrugged. \"He's dead. When the Khajiiti attacked Athay, they began by torching the harbor where Jurus was readying his boat. Or, I should say, my boat since it was purchased with the gold I brought. By the time we were even aware of what was happening enough to flee, everything by the water was ash. The Khajiiti may be animals, but they know how to arrange an attack.\"\n\"I think they followed us through the jungle to Vindisi,\" said Scotti nervously. \"There was definitely a group of something jumping along the treetops.\"\n\"Probably one of the monkey folk,\" snorted the Nord. \"Nothing to be concerned about.\"\n\"When we first came to Vindisi and the Bosmeri all entered that tree, they were furious, whispering something about unleashing an ancient terror on their enemies,\" the Breton shivered, remembering. \"They've been there ever since, for over a day and a half now. If you want something to be afraid of, that's the direction to look.\"\nThe other Breton, who was a representative of the Daggerfall Mages Guild, was staring off into the darkness while his fellow provincial spoke. \"Maybe. But there's something in the jungle too, right on the edge of the village, looking in.\"\n\"More refugees maybe?\" asked Scotti, trying to keep the alarm out his voice.\n\"Not unless they're traveling through the trees now,\" whispered the wizard. The Nord and one of the Cyrodiils grabbed a long tarp of wet leather and pulled it across the fire, instantly extinguishing it without so much as a sizzle. Now Scotti could see the intruders, their elliptical yellow eyes and long cruel blades catching the torchlight. He froze with fear, praying that he too was not so visible to them.\nHe felt something bump against his back, and gasped.\nReglius's voice hissed from up above: \"Be quiet for Mara's sake and climb up here.\"\nScotti grabbed hold of the knotted double-vine that hung down from a tall tree at the edge of the dead campfire. He scrambled up it as quickly as he could, holding his breath lest any grunt of exertion escape him. At the top of the vine, high above the village, was an abandoned nest from some great bird in a trident-shaped branch. As soon as Scotti had pulled himself into the soft, fragrant straw, Reglius pulled up the vine. No one else was there, and when Scotti looked down, he could see no one below. No one, that is except the Khajiiti, slowly moving toward the glow of the temple tree.\n\"Thank you,\" whispered Scotti, deeply touched that a competitor had helped him. He turned away from the village, and saw that the tree's upper branches brushed against the mossy rock walls that surrounded the valley below. \"How are you at climbing?\"\n\"You're mad,\" said Reglius under his breath. \"We should stay here until they leave.\"\n\"If they burn Vindisi like they did Athay and Grenos, we'll be dead sure as if we were on the ground,\" Scotti began the slow careful climb up the tree, testing each branch. \"Can you see what they're doing?\"\n\"I can't really tell,\" Reglius stared down into the gloom. \"They're at the front of the temple. I think they also have ... it looks like long ropes, trailing off behind them, off into the pass.\"\nScotti crawled onto the strongest branch that pointed toward the wet, rocky face of the cliff. It was not a far jump at all. So close, in fact, that he could smell the moisture and feel the coolness of the stone. But it was a jump nevertheless, and in his history as a clerk, he had never before leapt from a tree a hundred feet off the ground to a sheer rock. He pictured in his mind's eye the shadows that had pursued him through the jungle from the heights above. How their legs coiled to spring, how their arms snapped forward in an elegant fluid motion to grasp. He leapt.\nHis hands grappled for rock, but long thick cords of moss were more accessible. He held hard, but when he tried to plant his feet forward, they slipped up skyward. For a few seconds, he found himself upside down before he managed to pull himself into a more conventional position. There was a narrow outcropping jutting out of the cliff where he could stand and finally exhale.\n\"Reglius. Reglius. Reglius,\" Scotti did not dare to call out. In a minute, there was a shaking of branches, and Lord Vanech's man emerged. First his satchel, then his head, then the rest of him. Scotti started to whisper something, but Reglius shook his head violently and pointed downward. One of the Khajiiti was at the base of the tree, peering at the remains of the campfire.\nReglius awkwardly tried to balance himself on the branch, but as strong as it was it was exceedingly difficult with only one free hand. Scotti cupped his palms and then pointed at the satchel. It seemed to pain Reglius to let it out of his grasp, but he relented and tossed it to Scotti.\nThere was a small, almost invisible hole in the bag, and when Scotti caught it, a single gold coin dropped out. It rang as it bounced against the rock wall on the descent, a high soft sound that seemed like the loudest alarm Scotti had ever heard.\nThen many things happened very quickly.\nThe Cathay-Raht at the base of the tree looked up and gave a loud wail. The other Khajiiti followed in chorus, as the cat below crouched down and then sprung up into the lower branches. Reglius saw it below him, climbing up with impossible dexterity, and panicked. Even before he jumped, Scotti could tell that he was going to fall. With a cry, Reglius the Clerk plunged to the ground, breaking his neck on impact.\nA flash of white fire erupted from every crevice of the temple, and the moan of the Bosmeri prayer changed into something terrible and otherworldly. The climbing Cathay-Raht stopped and stared.\n\"Keirgo,\" it gasped. \"The Wild Hunt.\"\nIt was as if a crack in reality had opened wide. A flood of horrific beasts, tentacled toads, insects of armor and spine, gelatinous serpents, vaporous beings with the face of gods, all poured forth from the great hollow tree, blind with fury. They tore the Khajiiti in front of the temple to pieces. All the other cats fled for the jungle, but as they did so, they began pulling on the ropes they carried. In a few seconds time, the entire village of Vindisi was boiling with the lunatic apparitions of the Wild Hunt.\nOver the babbling, barking, howling horde, Scotti heard the Cyrodiils in hiding cry out as they were devoured. The Nord too was found and eaten, and both Bretons. The wizard had turned himself invisible, but the swarm did not rely on their sight. The tree the Cathay-Raht was in began to sway and rock from the impossible violence beneath it. Scotti looked at the Khajiiti's fear-struck eyes, and held out one of the cords of moss.\nThe cat's face showed its pitiful gratitude as it leapt for the vine. It didn't have time to entirely replace that expression when Scotti pulled back the cord, and watched it fall. The Hunt consumed it to the bone before it struck the ground.\nScotti's own jump up to the next outcropping of rock was immeasurably more successful. From there, he pulled himself to the top of the cliff and was able to look down into the chaos that had been the village of Vindisi. The Hunt's mass had grown and began to spill out through the pass out of the valley, pursuing the fleeing Khajiiti. It was then that the madness truly began.\nIn the moons' light, from Scotti's vantage, he could see where the Khajiiti had attached their ropes. With a thunderous boom, an avalanche of boulders poured over the pass. When the dust cleared, he saw that the valley had been sealed. The Wild Hunt had nowhere to turn but on itself.\nScotti turned his head, unable to bear to look at the cannibalistic orgy. The night jungle stood before him, a web of wood. He slung Reglius's satchel over his shoulder, and entered.\nA Dance in Fire, v5\nA Dance in Fire\nChapter 5\nby\nWaughin Jarth\n\n\"Soap! The forest will eat love!  Straight ahead!  Stupid and a stupid cow!\"\nThe voice boomed out so suddenly that Decumus Scotti jumped.  He stared off into the dim jungle glade from which he only heard animal and insect calls, and the low whistling of wind moments before.  It was a queer, oddly accented voice of indiscriminate gender, tremulous in its modulations, but unmistakably human.  Or, at very least, elven.  An isolated Bosmer perhaps with a poor grasp of the Cyrodilic language.  After countless hours of plodding through the dense knot of Valenwood jungle, any voice of slight familiarity sounded wondrous.\n\"Hello?\" he cried.\n\"Beetles on any names?  Certainly yesterday yes!\" the voice called back. \"Who, what, and when, and mice!\"\n\"I'm afraid I don't understand,\" replied Scotti, turning toward the brambled tree, thick as a wagon, where the voice had issued. \"But you needn't be afraid of me.  My name is Decumus Scotti.  I'm a Cyrodiil from the Imperial City.  I came here to help rebuild Valenwood after the war, you see, and now I'm rather lost.\"\n\"Gemstones and grilled slaves ... The war,\" moaned the voice and broke down into sobs.\n\"You know about the war?  I wasn't sure, I wasn't even sure how far away from the border I am now,\" Scotti began slowly walking toward the tree.  He dropped Reglius's satchel to the ground, and held out his empty hands. \"I'm unarmed.  I only want to know the way to the closest town.  I'm trying to meet my friend, Liodes Jurus, in Silvenar.\"\n\"Silvenar!\" the voice laughed.  It laughed even louder as Scotti circled the tree. \"Worms and wine!  Worms and wine!  Silvenar sings for worms and wine!\"\nThere was nothing to be found anywhere around the tree. \"I don't see you.  Why are you hiding?\"\nIn frustration born of hunger and exhaustion, he struck the tree trunk.  A sudden shiver of gold and red erupted from a hollow nook above, and Scotti was surrounded by six winged creatures scarcely more than a few inches long.  Bright crimson eyes were set on either side of tunnel-like protuberances, the animals' always open mouths.  They were legless, and their thin, rapidly beating, aureate wings seemed poorly constructed to transport their fat, swollen bellies.  And yet, they darted through the air like sparks from a fire.  Whirling about the poor clerk, they began chattering what he now understood to be perfect nonsense.\n\"Wines and worms, how far from the border am I!  Academic garnishments, and alas, Liodes Jurus!\"\n\"Hello, I'm afraid I'm unarmed?  Smoken flames and the closest town is dear Oblivion.\"\n\"Swollen on bad meat, an indigo nimbus, but you needn't be afraid of me!\"\n\"Why are you hiding?  Why are you hiding?  Before I begin to friend, love me, Lady Zuleika!\"\nFurious with the mimics, Scotti swung his arms, driving them up into the treetops.  He stomped back to the clearing and opened up the satchel again, as he had done some hours before.  There was still, unsurprisingly, nothing useful in the bag, and nothing to eat in any corner or pocket.  A goodly amount of gold (he smiled grimly, as he had done before, at the irony of being financially solvent in the jungle), a stack of neat blank contracts from Lord Vanech's building commission, some thin cord, and an oiled leather cloak for bad weather.  At least, Scotti considered, he had not suffered rain.\nA rolling moan of thunder reminded Scotti of what he had suspected for some weeks now.  He was cursed.\nWithin an hour's time, he was wearing the cloak and clawing his way through mud.  The trees, which had earlier allowed no sunlight in, provided no shelter against the pounding storm and wind.  The only sounds that pierced the pelting of the rain were the mocking calls of the flying creatures, flitting just above, babbling their nonsense.  Scotti bellowed at them, threw rocks, but they seemed enamored of his company.\nWhile he was reaching to grab a promising looking stone to hurl at his tormentors, Scotti felt something shift beneath his feet.  Wet but solid ground suddenly liquefied and became a rolling tide, rushing him forward.  Light as a leaf, he flew head over feet over head, until the mudflow dropped and he continued forward, plunging down into a river twenty-five feet below.\nThe storm passed quite as instantly as it had arrived.  The sun melted the dark clouds and warmed Scotti as he swam for the shore.  There, another sign of the Khajiiti incursion into Valenwood greeted him.  A small fishing village had stood there once, so recently extinct that it smoldered like a still-warm corpse.  Dirt cairns that had once housed fish by the smell of them had been ravaged, their bounty turned to ash.  Rafts and skiffs lay broken, scuttled, half-submerged.  All the villagers were no more, either dead or refugees far away.  Or so he presumed.  Something banged against the wall of one of the ruins.  Scotti ran to investigate.\n\"My name is Decumus Scotti?\" sang the first winged beast. \"I'm a Cyrodiil from?  The Imperial City?  I came here to help rebuild Valenwood after the war, you see, and now I'm rather lost?\"\n\"I swell to maculate, apeneck!\" agreed one of its companions. \"I don't see you.  Why are you hiding?\"\nAs they fell into chattering, Scotti began to search the rest of the village.  Surely the cats had left something behind, a scrap of dried meat, a morsel of fish sausage, anything.  But they had been immaculate in their complete annihilation.  There was nothing to eat anywhere.  Scotti did find one item of possible use under the tumbled remains of a stone hut.  A bow and two arrows made of bone.  The string had been lost, likely burned away in the heat of the fire, but he pulled the cord from Reglius's satchel and restrung it.\nThe creatures flew over and hovered nearby as he worked: \"The convent of the sacred Liodes Jurus?\"\n\"You know about the war!  Worms and wine, circumscribe a golden host, apeneck!\"\nThe moment the cord was taut, Scotti nocked an arrow and swung around, pulling the string tight against his chest.  The winged beasts, having had experience with archers before, shot off in all directions in a blur.  They needn't have bothered.  Scotti's first arrow dove into the ground three feet in front of him.  He swore and retrieved it.  The mimics, having likewise had experience with poor archers before, returned at once to hovering nearby and mocking Scotti.\nOn his second shot, Scotti did much better, in purely technical terms.  He remembered how the archers in Falinesti looked when he pulled himself out from under the hoarvor tick, and they were all taking aim at him.  He extended his left hand, right hand, and right elbow in a symmetrical line, drawing the bow so his hand touched his jawline, and he could see the creature in his sight like the arrow was a finger he was pointing with.  The bolt missed the target by only two feet, but it continued on its trajectory, snapping when it struck a rock wall.\nScotti walked to the river's edge.  He had only one arrow left, and perhaps, he considered, it would be most practical to find a slow-moving fish and fire it on that.  If he missed, at least there was less of a chance of breaking the shaft, and he could always retrieve it from the water.  A rather torpid, whiskered fish rolled by, and he took aim at it.\n\"My name is Decumus Scotti!\" one of the creatures howled, frightening the fish away. \"Stupid and a stupid cow!  Will you dance a dance in fire!\"\nScotti turned and aimed the arrow as he had done before.  This time, however, he remembered to plant his feet as the archers had done, seven inches apart, knees straight, left leg slightly forward to meet the angle of his right shoulder.  He released the last arrow.\nThe arrow also proved a serviceable prong for roasting the creature against the smoking hot stones of one of the ruins.  Its other companions had disappeared instantly after the beast was slain, and Scotti was able to dine in peace.  The meat proved to be delicious, if scarcely more than a first course.  He was picking the last of it from the bones, when a boat sailed into view from around the bend of the river.  At the helm were Bosmer sailors.  Scotti ran to the bank and waved his arms.  They averted their eyes and continued past.\n\"You bloody, callous bastards!\" Scotti howled. \"Knaves!  Hooligans! Apenecks!  Scoundrels!\"\nA gray-whiskered form came out from a hatch, and Scotti immediately recognized him as Gryf Mallon, the poet translator he had met in the caravan from Cyrodiil.\nHe peered Scotti's direction, and his eyes lit up with delight, \"Decumus Scotti!  Precisely the man I hoped to see!  I want to get your thoughts on a rather puzzling passage in the Mnoriad Pley Bar!  It begins 'I went weeping into the world, searching for wonders,' perhaps you're familiar with it?\"\n\"I'd like nothing better than to discuss the Mnoriad Pley Bar with you, Gryf!\" Scotti called back. \"Would you let me come aboard though first?\"\nOverjoyed at being on a ship bound for any port at all, Scotti was true to his word.  For over an hour as the boat rolled down the river past the blackened remnants of Bosmeri villages, he asked no questions and spoke nothing of his life over the past weeks: he merely listened to Mallon's theories of merethic Aldmeri esoterica.  The translator was undemanding of his guest's scholarship, accepting nods and shrugs as civilized conversation.  He even produced some wine and fish jelly, which he shared with Scotti absent-mindedly, as he expounded on his various theses.\nFinally, while Mallon was searching for a reference to some minor point in his notes, Scotti asked, \"Rather off subject, but I was wondering where we're bound.\"\n\"The very heart of the province, Silvenar,\" Mallon said, not looking up from the passage he was reading. \"It's somewhat bothersome, actually, as I wanted to go to Woodhearth first to talk to a Bosmer there who claims to have an original copy of Dirith Yalmillhiad, if you can believe it.  But for the time being, that has to wait.  Summurset Isle has surrounded the city, and is in the process of starving the citizenry until they surrender.  It's a tiresome prospect, since the Bosmeri are happy to eat one another, so there's a risk that at the end, only one fat wood elf will remain to wave the flag.\"\n\"That is vexing,\" agreed Scotti, sympathetically. \"To the east, the Khajiiti are burning everything, and to the west, the High Elves are waging war.  I don't suppose the borders to the north are clear?\"\n\"They're even worse,\" replied Mallon, finger on the page, still distracted. \"The Cyrodiils and Redguards don't want Bosmer refugees streaming into their provinces.  It only stands to reason.  Imagine how much more criminally inclined they'd be now that they're homeless and hungry.\"\n\"So,\" murmured Scotti, feeling a shiver. \"We're trapped in Valenwood.\"\n\"Not at all.  I need to leave fairly shortly myself, as my publisher has set a very definite deadline for my new book of translations.  From what I understand, one merely petitions to the Silvenar for special border protection and one can cross into Cyrodiil with impunity.\"\n\"Petition the Silvenar, or petition at Silvenar?\"\n\"Petition the Silvenar at Silvenar.  It's an odd nomenclature that is typical of this place, the sort of thing that makes my job as a translator that much more challenging.  The Silvenar, he, or rather they are the closest the Bosmeri have to a great leader.  The essential thing to remember about the Silvenar --\" Mallon smiled, finding the passage he was looking for, \"Here! 'A fortnight, inexplicable, the world burns into a dance.' There's that metaphor again.\"\n\"What were you saying about the Silvenar?\" asked Scotti. \"The essential thing to remember?\"\n\"I don't remember what I was saying,\" replied Mallon, turning back to his oration.\nIn a week's time, the little boat bumped along the shallow, calmer waters of the foaming current the Xylo had become, and Decumus Scotti first saw the city of Silvenar.  If Falinesti was a tree, then Silvenar was a flower.  A magnificent pile of faded shades of green, red, blue, and white, shining with crystalline residue.  Mallon had mentioned off-hand, when not otherwise explaining Aldmeri prosody, that Silvenar had once been a blossoming glade in the forest, but owing to some spell or natural cause, the trees' sap began flowing with translucent liqueur.  The process of the sap flowing and hardening over the colorful trees had formed the web of the city.  Mallon's description was intriguing, but it hardly prepared him for the city's beauty.\n\"What is the finest, most luxurious tavern here?\" Scotti asked one of the Bosmer boatmen.\n\"Prithala Hall,\" Mallon answered. \"But why don't you stay with me?  I'm visiting an acquaintance of mine, a scholar I think you'll find fascinating.  His hovel isn't much, but he has the most extraordinary ideas about the principles of a Merethic Aldmeri tribe the Sarmathi --\"\n\"Under any other circumstances, I would happily accept,\" said Scotti graciously. \"But after weeks of sleeping on the ground or on a raft, and eating whatever I could scrounge, I feel the need for some indulgent creature comforts.  And then, after a day or two, I'll petition the Silvenar for safe passage to Cyrodiil.\"\nThe men bade each other goodbye.  Gryf Mallon gave him the address of his publisher in the Imperial City, which Scotti accepted and quickly forgot.  The clerk wandered the streets of Silvenar, crossing bridges of amber, admiring the petrified forest architecture.  In front of a particularly estimable palace of silvery reflective crystal, he found Prithala Hall.\nHe took the finest room, and ordered a gluttonous meal of the finest quality.  At a nearby table, he saw two very fat fellows, a man and a Bosmer, remarking how much finer the food was there than at the Silvenar's palace.  They began to discuss the war and some issues of finances and rebuilding provincial bridges.  The man noticed Scotti looking at them, and his eyes flashed recognition.\n\"Scotti, is that you?  Kynareth, where have you been?  I've had to make all the contacts here on my own!\"\nAt the sound of his voice, Scotti recognized him.  The fat man was Liodes Jurus, vastly engorged.\nA Dance in Fire, v6\nA Dance in Fire\nChapter 6\nby\n\tWaughin Jarth\n\nDecumus Scotti sat down, listening to Liodes Jurus. The clerk could hardly believe how fat his former colleague at Lord Atrius's Building Commission had become. The piquant aroma of the roasted meat dish before Scotti melted away. All the other sounds and textures of Prithala Hall vanished all around him, as if nothing else existed but the vast form of Jurus. Scotti did not consider himself an emotional man, but he felt a tide flow over him at the sight and sound of the man whose badly written letters had been the guideposts that carried him from the Imperial City back in early Frost Fall.\n\"Where have you been?\" Jurus demanded again. \"I told you to meet me in Falinesti weeks ago.\"\n\"I was there weeks ago,\" Scotti stammered, too surprised to be indignant. \"I got your note to meet you in Athay, and so I went there, but the Khajiiti had burned it to the ground. Somehow, I found my way with the refugees in another village, and someone there told me that you had been killed.\"\n\"And you believed that right away?\" Jurus sneered.\n\"The fellow seemed very well-informed about you. He was a clerk from Lord Vanech's Building Commission named Reglius, and he said that you had also suggested that he come down to Valenwood to profit from the war.\"\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Jurus, after thinking a moment. \"I recall the name now. Well, it's good for business to have two representatives from Imperial building commissions here. We just need to all coordinate our bids, and all should be well.\"\n\"Reglius is dead,\" said Scotti. \"But I have his contracts from Lord Vanech's Commission.\"\n\"Even better,\" gasped Jurus, impressed. \"I never knew you were such a ruthless competitor, Decumus Scotti. Yes, this could certainly improve our position with the Silvenar. Have I introduced you to Basth here?\"\nScotti had only been dimly aware of the Bosmer's presence at the table with Jurus, which was surprising given that the mer's girth nearly equaled his dining companion. The clerk nodded to Basth coldly, still numb and confused. It had not left his mind that only any hour earlier, Scotti had intended to petition the Silvenar for safe passage through the border back to Cyrodiil. The thought of doing business with Jurus after all, of profiting from Valenwood war with Elsweyr, and now the second one with the Summurset Isle, seemed like something happening to another person.\n\"Your colleague and I were talking about the Silvenar,\" said Basth, putting down the leg of mutton he had been gnawing on. \"I don't suppose you've heard about his nature?\"\n\"A little, but nothing very specific. I got the impression that he's very important and very peculiar.\"\n\"He's the representative of the People, legally, physically, and emotionally,\" explained Jurus, a little annoyed at his new partner's lack of common knowledge. \"When they're healthy, so is he. When they're mostly female, so is he. When they cry for food or trade or an absence of foreign interference, he feels it too, and makes laws accordingly. In a way, he's a despot, but he's the people's despot.\"\n\"That sounds,\" said Scotti, searching for the appropriate word. \"Like ... bunk.\"\n\"Perhaps it is,\" shrugged Basth. \"But he has many rights as the Voice of the People, including the granting of foreign building and trade contracts. It's not important whether you believe us. Just think of the Silvenar as being like one of your mad Emperors, like Pelagius. The problem facing us now is that since Valenwood is being attacked on all sides, the Silvenar's aspect is now one of distrust and fear of foreigners. The one hope of his people, and thus of the Silvenar himself, is that the Emperor will intervene and stop the war.\"\n\"Will he?\" asked Scotti.\n\"You know as well as we do that the Emperor has not been himself lately,\" Jurus helped himself to Reglius's satchel and pulled out the blank contracts. \"Who knows what he'll choose to do or not do? That reality is not our concern, but these blessings from the late good sir Reglius make our job much simpler.\"\nThey discussed how they would represent themselves to the Silvenar into the evening. Scotti ate continuously, but not nearly so much as Jurus and Basth. When the sun had begun to rise in the hills, its light reddening through the crystal walls of the tavern, Jurus and Basth left to their rooms at the palace, granted to them diplomatically in lieu of an actual immediate audience with the Silvenar. Scotti went to his room. He thought about staying up a little longer to ruminate over Jurus's plans and see what might be the flaw in them, but upon touching the cool, soft bed, he immediately fell asleep.\nThe next afternoon, Scotti awoke, feeling himself again. In other words, timid. For several weeks now, he had been a creature bent on mere survival. He had been driven to exhaustion, attacked by several jungle beasts, starved, nearly drowned, and forced into discussions of ancient Aldmeri poetical works. The discussion he had with Jurus and Basth about how to dupe the Silvenar into signing their contracts seemed perfectly reasonable then. Scotti dressed himself in his old battered clothes and went downstairs in search of food and a peaceful place to think.\n\"You're up,\" cried Basth upon seeing him. \"We should go to the palace now.\"\n\"Now?\" whined Scotti. \"Look at me. I need new clothes. This isn't the way one should dress to pay a call on a prostitute, let alone the Voice of the People of Valenwood. I haven't even bathed.\"\n\"You must cease from this moment forward being a clerk, and become a student of mercantile trade,\" said Liodes Jurus grandly, taking Scotti by the arm and leading him into the sunlit boulevard outside. \"The first rule is to recognize what you represent to the prospective client, and what angle best suits you. You cannot dazzle him with opulent fashion and professional bearing, my dear boy, and it would be fatal if you attempted to. Trust me on this. Several others besides Basth and I are guests at the palace, and they have made the error of appearing too eager, too formal, too ready for business. They will never be granted audience with the Silvenar, but we have remained aloof ever since the initial rejection. I've dallied about the court, spread my knowledge of life in the Imperial City, had my ears pierced, attended promenades, eaten and drunk of all that was given to me. I dare say I've put on a pound or two. The message we've sent is clear: it is in his, not our, best interest to meet.\"\n\"Our plan worked,\" added Basth. \"When I told his minister that our Imperial representative had arrived, and that we were at last willing to meet with the Silvenar this morning, we were told to bring you there straightaway.\"\n\"Aren't we late then?\" asked Scotti.\n\"Very,\" laughed Jurus. \"But that's again part of the angle we're representing. Benevolent disinterest. Remember not to confuse the Silvenar with conventional nobility. His is the mind of the common people. When you grasp that, you'll understand how to manipulate him.\"\nJurus spent the last several minutes of the walk through the city expounding on his theories about what Valenwood needed, how much, and at what price. They were staggering figures, far more construction and far higher costs than anything Scotti had been used to dealing with. He listened carefully. All around them, the city of Silvenar revealed itself, glass and flower, roaring winds and beautiful inertia. When they reached the palace of the Silvenar, Decumus Scotti stopped, stunned. Jurus looked at him for a moment and then laughed.\n\"It's quite bizarre, isn't it?\"\nThat it was. A frozen scarlet burst of twisted, uneven spires as if a rival sun rising. A blossom the size of a village, where courtiers and servants resembled nothing so much as insects walked about it sucking its ichor. Entering over a bent petal-like bridge, the three walked through the palace of unbalanced walls. Where the partitions bent close together and touched, there was a shaded hall or a small chamber. Where they warped away from one another, there was a courtyard. There were no doors anywhere, no any way to get to the Silvenar but by crossing through the entire spiral of the palace, through meetings and bedrooms and dining halls, past dignitaries, consorts, musicians, and many guards.\n\"It's an interesting place,\" said Basth. \"But not very much privacy. Of course, that suits the Silvenar well.\"\nWhen they reached the inner corridors, two hours after they first entered the palace, guards, brandishing blades and bows, stopped them.\n\"We have an audience with the Silvenar,\" said Jurus, patiently. \"This is Lord Decumus Scotti, the Imperial representative.\"\nOne of the guards disappeared down the winding corridor, and returned moments later with a tall, proud Bosmer clad in a loose robe of patchwork leather. He was the Minister of Trade: \"The Silvenar wishes to speak with Lord Decumus Scotti alone.\"\nIt was not the place to argue or show fear, so Scotti stepped forward, not even looking toward Jurus and Basth. He was certain they were showing their masks of benevolent indifference. Following the Minister into the audience chamber, Scotti recited to himself all the facts and figures Jurus had presented to him. He willed himself to remember the Angle and the Image he must project.\nThe audience chamber of the Silvenar was an enormous dome where the walls bent from bowl-shaped at the base inward to almost meet at the top. A thin ray of sunlight streamed through the fissure hundreds of feet above, and directly upon the Silvenar, who stood upon a puff of shimmering gray powder. For all the wonder of the city and the palace, the Silvenar himself looked perfectly ordinary. An average, blandly handsome, slightly tired-looking, extra-ordinary Wood Elf of the type one might see in any capitol in the Empire. It was only when he stepped from the dais that Scotti noticed an eccentricity in his appearance. He was very short.\n\"I had to speak with you alone,\" said the Silvenar in a voice common and unrefined. \"May I see your papers?\"\nScotti handed him the blank contracts from Lord Vanech's Building Commission. The Silvenar studied them, running his finger over the embossed seal of the Emperor, before handing them back. He suddenly seemed shy, looking to the floor. \"There are many charlatans at my court who wish to benefit from the wars. I thought you and your colleagues were among them, but those contracts are genuine.\"\n\"Yes, they are,\" said Scotti calmly. The Silvenar's conventional aspect made it easy for Scotti to speak, with no formal greetings, no deference, exactly as Jurus had instructed: \"It seems most sensible to begin straightaway talking about the roads which need to be rebuilt, and then the harbors that the Altmeri have destroyed, and then I can give you my estimates on the cost of resupplying and renovating the trade routes.\"\n\"Why hasn't the Emperor seen fit to send a representative when the war with Elsweyr began, two years ago?\" asked the Silvenar glumly.\nScotti thought a moment before replying of all the common Bosmeri he had met in Valenwood. The greedy, frightened mercenaries who had escorted him from the border. The hard-drinking revelers and expert pest exterminating archers in the Western Cross of Falinesti. Nosy old Mother Pascost in Havel Slump. Captain Balfix, the poor sadly reformed pirate. The terrified but hopeful refugees of Athay and Grenos. The mad, murderous, self-devouring Wild Hunt of Vindisi. The silent, dour boatmen hired by Gryf Mallon. The degenerate, grasping Basth. If one creature represented their total disposition, and that of many more throughout the province, what would be his personality? Scotti was a clerk by occupation and nature, instinctively comfortable cataloging and filing, making things fit in a system. If the soul of Valenwood were to be filed, where would it be put?\nThe answer came upon him almost before he posed himself the question. Denial.\n\"I'm afraid that question doesn't interest me,\" said Scotti. \"Now, can we get back to the business at hand?\"\nAll afternoon, Scotti and the Silvenar discussed the pressing needs of Valenwood. Every contract was filled and signed. So much was required and there were so many costs associated that addendums and codicils had to be scribbled into the margins of the papers, and those had to be resigned. Scotti maintained his benevolent indifference, but he found that dealing with the Silvenar was not quite the same as dealing with a simple, sullen child. The Voice of the People knew certain practical, everyday things very well: the yields of fish, the benefits of trade, the condition of every township and forest in his province.\n\"We will have a banquet tomorrow night to celebrate this commission,\" said the Silvenar at last.\n\"Best make it tonight,\" replied Scotti. \"We should leave for Cyrodiil with the contracts tomorrow, so I'll need a safe passage to the border. We best not waste any more time.\"\n\"Agreed,\" said the Silvenar, and called for his Minister of Trade to put his seal on the contracts and arrange for the feast.\nScotti left the chamber, and was greeted by Basth and Jurus. Their faces showed the strain of maintaining the illusion of unconcern for too many hours. As soon as they were out of sight of the guards, they begged Scotti to tell them all. When he showed them the contract, Basth began weeping with delight.\n\"Anything about the Silvenar that surprised you?\" asked Jurus.\n\"I hadn't expected him to be half my height.\"\n\"Was he?\" Jurus looked mildly surprised. \"He must have shrunk since I tried to have an audience with him earlier. Maybe there is something to all that nonsense about him being affected by the plight of his people.\"\nA Dance in Fire, v7\nA Dance in Fire\nChapter 7\nBy\nWaughin Jarth\nScene: Silvenar, Valenwood\nDate: 13 Sun's Dusk, 3E 397\nThe banquet at the palace of the Silvenar was well attended by every jealous bureaucrat and trader who had attempted to contract the rebuilding of Valenwood.  They looked on Decumus Scotti, Liodes Jurus, and Basth with undisguised hatred.  It made Scotti very uncomfortable, but Jurus delighted in it.  As the servants brought in platter after platter of roasted meats, Jurus poured himself a cup of Jagga and toasted the clerk.\n\"I can confess it now,\" said Jurus. \"I had grave doubts about inviting you to join me on this adventure.  All the other clerks and agents of building commissions I contacted were more outwardly aggressive, but none of them made it through, let alone to the audience chamber of the Silvenar, let alone brokered the deals on their own like you did.  Come, have a cup of Jagga with me.\"\n\"No thank you,\" said Scotti. \"I had too much of that drug in Falinesti, and nearly got sucked dry by a giant tick because of it.  I'll find something else to drink.\"\nScotti wandered about the hall until he saw some diplomats drinking mugs of a steaming brown liquid, poured from a large silver urn.  He asked them if it was tea.\n\"Tea made from leaves?\" scoffed the first diplomat. \"Not in Valenwood.  This is Rotmeth.\"\nScotti poured himself a mug and took a tentative sip.  It was gamy, bitter and sugared, and very salty.  At first it seemed very disagreeable to his palate, but a moment later he found he had drained the mug and was pouring another.  His body tingled.  All the sounds in the chamber seemed oddly disjointed, but not frighteningly so.\n\"So you're the fellow who got the Silvenar to sign all those contracts,\" said the second diplomat. \"That must have required some deep negotiation.\"\n\"Not at all, not at all, just a little basic understand of mercantile trading,\" grinned Scotti, pouring himself a third mug of Rotmeth. \"The Silvenar was very eager to involve the Imperial state with the affairs of Valenwood.  I was very eager to take a percentage of the commission.  With all that blessed eagerness, it was merely a matter of putting quill to contract, bless you.\"\n\"You have been in the employ of his Imperial Majesty very long?\" asked the first diplomat.\n\"It's a bite, or rather, a bit more complicated than that in the Imperial City.  Between you and me, I don't really have a job.  I used to work for Lord Atrius and his Building Commission, but I got sacked.  And then, the contracts are from Lord Vanech and his Building Commission, 'cause I got em from this fellow Reglius who is a competitor but still a very fine fellow until he was made dead by those Khajiiti,\" Scotti drained his fifth mug. \"When I go back to the Imperial City, then the real negotiations can begin, bless you.  I can go to my old employer and to Lord Vanech, and say, look here you, which one of you wants these commissions?  And they'll fall over each other to take them from me.  It will be bidding war for my percentage the likes of which no one nowhere has never seen.\"\n\"So you're not a representative of his Imperial Majesty, the Emperor?\" asked the first diplomat.\n\"Didn't you hear what I'm said? You stupid?\" Scotti felt a surge of rage, which quickly subsided.  He chuckled, and poured himself a seventh mug. \"The Building Commissions are privately owned, but they're still representatives of the Emperor.  So I'm a representative of the Emperor.  Or I will be.  When I get these contracts in.  It's very complicated.  I can understand why you're not following me.  Bless you, it's all like the poet said, a dance in fire, if you follow the illusion, that is to say, allusion.\"\n\"And your colleagues?  Are they representatives of the Emperor?\" asked the second diplomat.\nScotti burst into laughter, shaking his head.  The diplomats bade him their respects and went to talk to the Minister.  Scotti stumbled out of the palace, and reeled through the strange, organic avenues and boulevards of the city.  It took him several hours to find his way to Prithala Hall and his room.  Once there, he slept, very nearly on his bed.\nThe next morning, he woke to Jurus and Basth in his room, shaking him.  He felt half-asleep and unable to open his eyes fully, but otherwise fine.  The conversation with the diplomats floated in his mind in a haze, like an obscure childhood memory.\n\"What in Mara's name is Rotmeth?\" he asked quickly.\n\"Rancid, strongly fermented meat juices with lots of spices to kill the poisons,\" smiled Basth. \"I should have warned you to stay with Jagga.\"\n\"You must understand the Meat Mandate by now,\" laughed Jurus. \"These Bosmeri would rather eat each other than touch the fruit of the vine or the field.\"\n\"What did I say to those diplomats?\" cried Scotti, panicking.\n\"Nothing bad apparently,\" said Jurus, pulling out some papers. \"Your escorts are downstairs to bring you to the Imperial Province.  Here are your papers of safe passage.  The Silvenar seems very impatient about business proceeding forward rapidly.  He promises to send you some sort of rare treasure when the contracts are fulfilled.  See, he's already given me something.\"\nJurus showed off his new, bejeweled earring, a beautiful large faceted ruby.  Basth showed that he had a similar one.  The two fat fellows left the room so Scotti could dress and pack.\nA full regiment of the Silvenar's guards was on the street in front of the tavern.  They surrounded a carriage crested with the official arms of Valenwood.  Still dazed, Scotti climbed in, and the captain of the guard gave the signal.  They began a quick gallop.  Scotti shook himself, and then peered behind.  Basth and Jurus were waving him goodbye.\n\"Wait!\" Scotti cried. \"Aren't you coming back to the Imperial Province too?\"\n\"The Silvenar asked that we stay behind as Imperial representatives!\" yelled Liodes Jurus. \"In case there's a need for more contracts and negotiations!  He's appointed us Undrape, some sort of special honor for foreigners at court!  Don't worry!  Lots of banquets to attend!  You can handle the negotiations with Vanech and Atrius yourself and we'll keep things settled here!\"\nJurus continued to yell advice about business, but his voice became indistinct with distance.  Soon it disappeared altogether as the convoy rounded the streets of Silvenar.  The jungle loomed suddenly and then they were in it.  Scotti had only gone through it by foot or along the rivers by slow-moving boats.  Now it flashed all around him in profusions of greens.  The horses seemed even faster moving through underbrush than on the smooth paths of the city.  None of the weird sounds or dank smells of the jungle penetrated the escort.  It felt to Scotti as if he were watching a play about the jungle with a background of a quickly moving scrim, which offered only the merest suggestion of the place.\nSo it went for two weeks.  There was lots of food and water in the carriage with the clerk, so he merely ate and slept as the caravan pressed endlessly on.  From time to time, he'd hear the sound of blades clashing, but when he looked around whatever had attacked the caravan had long since been left behind.  At last, they reached the border, where an Imperial garrison was stationed.\nScotti presented the soldiers who met the carriage with the papers.  They asked him a barrage of questions that he answered monosyllabically, and then let him pass.  It took several more days to arrive at the gates of the Imperial City.  The horses that had flown so fast through the jungle now slowed down in the unfamiliar territory of the wooded Colovian Estates.  By contrast, the cries of his province's birds and smells of his province's plant life brought Decumus Scotti alive.  It was if he had been dreaming all the past months.\nAt the gates of the City, Scotti's carriage door was opened for him and he stepped out on uncertain legs.  Before he had a moment to say something to the escort, they had vanished, galloping back south through the forest.  The first thing he did now that he was home was go to the closest tavern and have tea and fruit and bread.  If he never ate meat again, he told himself, that would suit him very nicely.\nNegotiations with Lord Atrius and Lord Vanech proceeded immediately thereafter.  It was most agreeable.  Both commissions recognized how lucrative the rebuilding of Valenwood would be for their agency.  Lord Vanech claimed, quite justifiably, that as the contracts had been written on forms notarized by his commission, he had the legal right to them.  Lord Atrius claimed that Decumus Scotti was his agent and representative, and that he had never been released from employment.  The Emperor was called to arbitrate, but he claimed to be unavailable.  His advisor, the Imperial Battlemage Jagar Tharn, had disappeared long ago and could not be called on for his wisdom and impartial mediation.\nScotti lived very comfortably off the bribes from Lord Atrius and Lord Vanech.  Every week, a letter would arrive from Jurus or Basth asking about the status of negotiations.  Gradually, these letters ceased coming, and more urgent ones came from the Minister of Trade and the Silvenar himself.  The War of the Blue Divide with Summurset Isle ended with the Altmeri winning several new coastal islands from the Wood Elves.  The war with Elsweyr continued, ravaging the eastern borders of Valenwood.  Still, Vanech and Atrius fought over who would help.\nOne fine morning in the early spring of the year 3E 398, a courier arrived at Decumus Scotti's door.\n\"Lord Vanech has won the Valenwood commission, and requests that you and the contracts come to his hall at your earliest convenience.\"\n\"Has Lord Atrius decided not to challenge further?\" asked Scotti.\n\"He's been unable to, having died very suddenly, just now, from a terribly unfortunate accident,\" said the courier.\nScotti had wondered how long it would be before the Dark Brotherhood was brought in for final negotiations.  As he walked toward Lord Vanech's Building Commission, a long, severe piece of architecture on a minor but respectable plaza, he wondered if he had played the game, as he ought to have.  Could Vanech be so rapacious as to offer him a lower percentage of the commission now that his chief competitor was dead?  Thankfully, he discovered, Lord Vanech had already decided to pay Scotti what he had proposed during the heat of the winter negotiations.  His advisors had explained to him that other, lesser building commissions might come forward unless the matter were handled quickly and fairly.\n\"Glad we have all the legal issues done with,\" said Lord Vanech, fondly. \"Now we can get to the business of helping the poor Bosmeri, and collecting the profits.  It's a pity you weren't our representative for all the troubles with Bend'r-mahk and the Arnesian business.  But there will be plenty more wars, I'm sure of that.\"\nScotti and Lord Vanech sent word to the Silvenar that at last they were prepared to honor the contracts.  A few weeks later, they held a banquet in honor of the profitable enterprise.  Decumus Scotti was the darling of the Imperial City, and no expense was spared to make it an unforgettable evening.\nAs Scotti met the nobles and wealthy merchants who would be benefiting from his business dealings, an exotic but somehow faintly familiar smell rose in the ballroom.  He traced it to its source: a thick roasted slab of meat, so long and thick it covered several platters.  The Cyrodilic revelers were eating it ravenously, unable to find the words to express their delight at its taste and texture.\n\"It's like nothing I've ever had before!\"\n\"It's like pig-fed venison!\"\n\"Do you see the marbling of fat and meat?  It's a masterpiece!\"\nScotti went to take a slice, but then he saw something imbedded deep in the dried and rendered roast.  He nearly collided with his new employer Lord Vanech as he stumbled back.\n\"Where did this come from?\" Scotti stammered.\n\"From our client, the Silvenar,\" beamed his lordship. \"It's some kind of local delicacy they call Unthrappa.\"\nScotti vomited, and didn't stop for some time.  It cast rather a temporary pall on the evening, but when Decumus Scotti was carried off to his manor house, the guests continued to dine.  The Unthrappa was the delight of all.  Even more so when Lord Vanech himself took a slice and found the first of two rubies buried within.  How very clever of the Bosmer to invent such a dish, the Cyrodiils agreed."

    "text": "In a few hours, I will likely be dead.\nMy men and I, Nords of Skyrim all, will soon join with the Emperor's legions to attack the Imperial City. The Aldmeri are entrenched within and our losses will be severe.  It is a desperate gambit, for if we do not reclaim the city, we will lose the war.\nLast night I prayed to mighty Talos for courage and strength in the battle to come. In these last cold hours before the sun rises, I sit down to write this account of a dream I had not long after.\nI believe this dream was the answer to my prayers, and I would pass along the wisdom it contained to my kinsmen, for the battles they will fight in the years after my passing.\nIn the dream, I walked through mists toward the sound of laughter, merriment and the songs of the north. The mists soon cleared, and before me lay a great chasm. Waters thundered over its brim, and so deep it was, I could not see the bottom.\nA great bridge made all of whale-bone was the only means to cross, and so I took it.\nIt was only a few steps onto the bridge that I encountered a warrior, grim and strong. \"I am Tsun, master of trials,\"  he said to me, his voice booming and echoing upon the walls of the high mountains all around us.\nWith a wave, he bade me pass on. I knew in my heart that I was granted passage only because I was a visitor. Should the hour come when I return here after my mortal life, the legends say that I must best this dread warrior in single combat.\nBeyond the bridge, a great stone longhouse rose up before me, so tall as to nearly touch the clouds. Though it took all my strength, I pushed open the towering oaken door and beheld the torch-lit feast hall.\nHere were assembled the greatest heroes of the Nords, all drinking mead poured from great kegs and singing battle-songs. Suckling pigs turned on a long iron spit over a roaring fire. My mouth watered at the smell of roast meat, and my heart was glad to hear the songs of old.\n\"Come forth!\" cried out a hoary man who sat upon a high wooden chair. This I knew to be Ysgramor, father of Skyrim and the Nords. I approached and knelt before him.\n\"You find yourself in Sovngarde, hall of the honored dead. Now, what would you have of me, son of the north?\" he bellowed.\n\"I seek counsel,\" said I, \"for tomorrow we fight a desperate battle and my heart is full of fear.\"\nYsgramor raised his tankard to his lips and drank until the cup was empty. Then he spoke once more.\n\"Remember this always, son of the north - a Nord is judged not by the manner in which he lived, but the manner in which he died.\"\nWith that, he cast aside his flagon, raised his fist in the air and roared a great cheer. The other heroes rose to their feet and cheered in answer.\nThe sound still rang in my ears when I awoke. I gathered my men and told them of my vision. The words seemed to fill their hearts with courage.\nThe horns are blowing, and the banners are raised. The time has come to muster. May Talos grant us victory this day, and if I am found worthy, may I once again look upon that great feast hall.\n- Skardan Free-Winter"

    "text": "\nWelcome, good sir, to this indispensible guide. Within these pages, I, your humble author and guide, will describe to you the great city of Whiterun, the Jewel of the North.\nWhiterun offers numerous diversions for the man in search of adventure, fortune and companionship, whether for a night or for a lifetime. The city is graced with not one, but two worthy taverns and there are maids and wenches aplenty.\nThe city is located rather centrally in Skyrim, and this is well, for it is not far from anywhere. Perched high upon a rocky hill, Whiterun dominates the grassy plains that surround it. High wooden walls protect its denizens from the wolves, mammoths, bandits and other dangers lurking beyond.\nWhen you first enter through the city's main gate, you will find yourself in the Plains District. This is so named because it is the lowest of the city's three neighborhoods.\nAh, but here can be found the Bannered Mare, which I count among the finest taverns in all Skyrim. The scenery within is quite compelling, if you have an eye for the fairer sex.\nA stout lass named Hulda tends the bar. Don't let that stony Nord exterior fool you, for she is possessed of that same fiery passion that all Nord women try so hard to conceal. Saadia, the barmaid, is an exotic Redguard beauty. She is quite mysterious, and your humble author is determined to learn her secrets.\nOutside the Bannered Mare is a modest marketplace, and here is where I found true love. Though I would never deter a fellow hunting hound from the chase - for indeed, why should I author these tomes, if not to provide guidance in this very matter? - I must ask that you do me this one kindness.\nHer name is Carlotta Valentia, and she is a magnificent beauty who makes a modest living selling bread and produce in the daylight hours. By the gods, I will make that feisty beauty mine someday!\nAnd of course, there are other services to be found in the Plains district. Belethor's General Goods offers various and sundry wears for the adventurous traveler, and Arcadia's Cauldron offers what tonics and herbs one would expect from an apothecary's shop.\nArcadia herself is an amiable sort. I often visit her to make conversation, as she is a fellow Imperial far from home. She is, however, a bit old for my taste. A gentleman of advanced years might find in her a worthy companion.\nShould you need your blade sharpened or your armor hammered, Warmaiden's offers smithing services very near the main gate. The smith is a pretty Nord named Adrianne Avenicci, but she is married to a great hulking brute named Ulfberth War-Bear.\nAdrianne is quite fair, but I should not want to find myself being introduced to the keen edge of that husband's war-axe. If married ladies are your preferred sport, then have at, but don't say that you weren't warned!\nNear to the smith is the Drunken Huntsman. Here, some of the wealthier gentlemen gather to share both drink and rumors of the wide world. If you prefer a more distinguished class of company while you sip fine wine, you'll be well at home here.\nOf the Wind district I have little to say. Most of the buildings in this second tier of the city are residences, though there is also a Temple of Kynareth and Jorrvaskr, the mead hall of the Companions.\nThere are some intriguing prospects to be found in the mead hall should you favor a strong and fearless warrior-woman. You will find little game at the temple, however. The priestess, Danica Pure-Spring, is interested almost exclusively in spiritual matters.\nAt last we come to the Cloud District, exclusive domain of the Jarl's castle. I have had some merry adventures within the stone walls of Dragonsreach, let me tell you. The serving girls are most easily impressed by a well-spoken Imperial. After all, the nights in Skyrim do grow quite cold, if you take my meaning.\nAnd I will not deny that I have visited the town's jail once or twice, which can be found in the lower levels of the palace.\nAs for the Jarl and his court, take pains to avoid them. I find that they lack any sense of humor or appreciation for the Imperial culture. Besides which, they are all wealthy men and so must be viewed as your most serious competition. These Nords are simple folk, after all, and too easily swayed by the sight of fine clothes and a purse full of septims.\nNow I will conclude this work by wishing you great success in your pursuits of women and wine. Spare a moment in your revels to think of me, your humble author, and the risks I have taken to bring you this most thorough report on all thing of interest to the discerning gentleman in the grand city of Whiterun.\nAh, but I will not lie and say that it was all a hardship. After all, who could want to sleep alone in such a cold and hard land as this? Not I!"

    "text": "A Minor Maze:\nShalidor & Labyrinthian\n\nLabyrinthian's modern notoriety was gained in the early part of the Third Era. Part of the Staff of Chaos was recovered from the Labyrinthian, which became instrumental in the overthrow of Jagar Tharn, ending the Imperial Simulacrum. The site has since become embedded in the minds of all subjects of the Empire, and the ruins are occasionally visited by Loyalist pilgrims, re-tracing the steps of the Eternal Champion.\nThe namesake of Labyrinthian is somewhat less commonly known, however.\nThe foreboding ruins were originally built as a temple to the Dragons. This grew into Bromjunaar, a great city of that era. Bromjunaar is believed by some to have been the capital of Skyrim at the height of the Dragon Cult's influence there. Little historical record exists to verify or refute this, but it is known that the highest ranking Priests of the Cult met at Labyrinthian to discuss matters of ruling.\nBromjunaar crumbled, however, along with the rest of the Dragon Cult, and the site lay abandoned for many years, a deteriorating reminder of those benighted days for the Nords. Not until the days of Shalidor would the ruins come into use again.\nShalidor the Archmage was famous for his exploits in the First Era. Various tales tell of him battling Dwemer legions single-handedly, building the city of Winterhold with a whispered spell, stealing the secret of life from Akatosh, or constructing Labyrinthian himself.\nWhile many Shalidor legends are hyperbole or outright fabrication, we can discover some truth behind his involvement with Labyrinthian.\nShalidor stood at the forefront of a movement to enact higher standards among mages, and to discourage spell-use among the common castes. This effort is dubiously credited with the original organization and formation of the schools of magic and the foundation of the College at Winterhold.\nConsistent with this mentality, Shalidor constructed his Labyrinth deep within the ruins of Bromjunaar to test new Archmages. While navigating the destroyed city itself was not explicitly a part of the test, many candidates did not survive the journey. Shalidor valued both academic knowledge as well as practical skill, and simply getting to the Labyrinth required the latter.\n\nShalidor's Labyrinthian is actually two intersecting mazes, in an hourglass pattern. One maze could not be completed without exiting the other first, which makes the only existing instruction for the test especially mysterious:\nEnter Twice - Exit Only Once\nAlteration will lead \nyou to Destruction\nOnly Illusion shows the \nway to Restoration\nConjure not, but \nbe conjured instead\nWe can only guess at what the solution to the test may have been, as Labyrinthian became notorious not only for the number of potential archmages who died there, but for the intense secrecy of those who succeeded.\nLabyrinthian eventually ceased to be used, and is regarded as a symbol of a more brutal age by modern institutions for magical studies. The ruins lay empty again, overrun with wild animals and avoided by travelers. The long history and legacy of this place, however, seems as likely to be erased from our minds as the ruins themselves are likely to sink into the sea."

When the scattered Dunmer tribes consolidated into the predecessors of the modern Great House clans, they threw out the Nord oppressors and successfully resisted further incursions.\nThe ancient ancestor worship of the tribes was in time superseded by the monolithic Tribunal Temple theocracy, and the Dunmer grew into a great nation called Resdayn. Resdayn was the last of the provinces to submit to Tiber Septim; like Black Marsh, it was never successfully invaded, and was peacefully incorporated by treaty into the Empire as the Province of Morrowind.\nAlmost four centuries after the coming of the Imperial Legions, Morrowind is still occupied by Imperial legions, with a figurehead Imperial King, though the Empire has reserved most functions of the traditional local government to the Ruling Councils of the Five Great Houses....\nIn 3E 414, Vvardenfell Territory, previously a Temple preserve under Imperial protection, was reorganized as an Imperial Provincial District. Vvardenfell had been maintained as a preserve administrated by the Temple since the Treaty of the Armistice, and except for a few Great House settlements sanctioned by the Temple, Vvardenfell was previously uninhabited and undeveloped. But when the centuries-old Temple ban on trade and settlement of Vvardenfell was revoked by King of Morrowind, a flood of Imperial colonists and Great House Dunmer came to Vvardenfell, expanding old settlements and building new ones.\nThe new District was divided into Redoran, Hlaalu, Telvanni, and Temple Districts, each separately administered by local House Councils or Temple Priesthoods, and all under the advice and consent of Duke Dren and the District Council in Ebonheart. Local law became a mixture of House Law and Imperial Law in House Districts, jointly enforced by House guards and Legion guards, with Temple law and Imperial law enforced in the Temple district by Ordinators. The Temple was still recognized as the majority religion, but worship of the Nine Divines was protected by the legions and encouraged by Imperial cult missions.\nThe Temple District included the city of Vivec, the fortress of Ghostgate, and all sacred and profane sites (including those Blighted areas inside the Ghostfence) and all unsettled and wilderness areas on Vvardenfell. In practice, this district included all parts of Vvardenfell not claimed for Redoran, Hlaalu, or Telvanni Districts. The Temple stubbornly fought all development in their district, and were largely successful.\nHouse Hlaalu in combination with Imperial colonists embarked on a vigorous campaign of settlement and development. In the decades after reorganization, Balmora and the Ascadian Isles regions have grown steadily. Caldera and Pelagiad are completely new settlements, and all legion forts were expanded to accommodate larger garrisons.\nHouse Telvanni, normally conservative and isolationist, has been surprisingly aggressive in expanding beyond their traditional tower villages. Disregarding the protests of the other Houses, the Temple, the Duke, and the District council, Telvanni pioneers have been encroaching on the wild lands reserved to the Temple. The Telvanni council officially disavows responsibility for these rogue Telvanni settlements, but it is an open secret that they are encouraged and supported by ambitious Telvanni mage-lords.\nUnder pressure from the Temple, conservative House Redoran has steadfastly resisted expansion in their district. As a result, House Redoran and the Temple are in danger of being politically and economically marginalized by the more aggressive and expansionist Hlaalu and Telvanni interests.\nThe Imperial administration faces many challenges in the Vvardenfell district, but the most serious are the Great House rivalries, animosity from the Ashlander nomads, internal conflicts within the Temple itself, and the Red Mountain blight. Struggles between Great House, Temple, and Imperial interests to control Vvardenfell's resource could at any time erupt into full-scale war. Ashlanders raid settlements, plunder caravans, and kill foreigners on their wild lands. The Temple has unsuccessfully attempted to silence criticism and calls for reform within its ranks.\nBut most serious are the plagues and diseased hosts produced by the blight storms sweeping out from Red Mountain. Vvardenfell and all Morrowind have long been menaced by the legendary evils of Dagoth Ur and his ash vampire kin dwelling beneath Red Mountain. For centuries the Temple has contained this threat within the Ghostfence. But recently the Temple's resources and will have faltered, and the threat from Red Mountain has grown in scale and intensity. If the Ghostfence should fail, and hosts of blighted monsters were to spill out across Vvardenfell's towns and villages, the Empire might have no choice but to evacuate Vvardenfell district and abandon it to disease and corruption."

    "text": "Ahzidal's Descent\nby\n\tHalund Greycloak\nIn the days beyond memory, when men first walked the lands of Skyrim, there arose in the city of Saarthal a great enchanter. As a boy, his gift for magic and artifice had been evident to his tutors. As a man, his skill surpassed them all. And finding nothing more to learn among his kin, he left wife and child, and set out to train under the elven masters.\nA year became two, then three. And when finally his path led him back to Saarthal, he found only ruins: for the elves had sacked the city, and all that lived there were dead or gone. Amid the ashes, in the smoldering ruins of his home, he swore a terrible oath of vengeance. And from that comes the name the legends give him: Ahzidal, the embittered destroyer.\nAlone, he could do nothing. And so, he bided his time, delving deeper into his art than any before him. From the Dwemer, he learned the seven natures of metal and how to harmonize them. From the Ayleids, the ancient runes and dawn-magic even the elves had begun to forget. Among Falmer and Chimer and Altmer he traveled, taking what he could from each, and all the while plotting how he might turn that knowledge against them.\nFinally, word reached him of Ysgramor and his Companions, newly-arrived from Atmora. For three days and nights, he rode north, and met them as they made landfall on the icy coast near the ruins of Saarthal, which the elves had fortified against them. He offered the Companions his service, and all he had produced in his years of labor. And with Atmoran steel imbued with his enchantments, the elves fell before them, and at last he had his revenge.\nBut he was not content. His craft had become his life, and his hunger for knowledge still gnawed at him, driving him to delve ever deeper. At long last, he exhausted the lore of the elves, but it was not enough. He sought the secrets of Dragon-runes, and won for himself a seat among their high priests, but it was not enough. And at length, he turned his gaze to the planes of Oblivion, and found there both power and madness.\nSome say he ventured there, never to return. Others, that he was betrayed by his fellow Dragon Priests, and killed, or driven into hiding in the ruins beneath his beloved Saarthal. Among the Skaal of Solstheim, it is said he fled to their island, and was sealed in the depths of Kolbjorn Barrow, together with the last of his relics.\nBut that is the tale, as it was told among the bards of Winterhold. Whatever the truth, the legend of Ahzidal was intended as a warning: in pursuit of perfection, one must take care that the pursuit itself does not become all-consuming."

    "text": "This is an absurd book.  But like all things Khajiiti, as the expression goes, \"gzalzi vaberzarita maaszi\", or \"absurdity has become necessity.\"  Much of what I have to say has probably never been written before, and if it has, no one has read it.  The Imperials feel that everything must be written down for posterity, but every Khajiiti kitten born in Elsweyr knows his history, he drinks it in with his mother's milk.\nFairly recently, however, our struggles to win back our homeland from the rapacious Count of Leyawiin have attracted sympathetic persons, even Imperials, who wish to join our cause, but, it seems, do not understand our ways.  Our enemies, of course, do not understand us either, but that is as we wish it, a weapon in our arsenal.  Our non-Khajiiti friends, however, should know who we are, why we are, and what we are doing.\nThe Khajiit mind is not engineered for self-reflection.  We simply do what we do, and let the world be damned.  To put into words and rationalize our philosophy is foreign, and I cannot guarantee that even after reading this, you will understand us.  Grasp this simple truth -- \"q'zi no vano thzina ualizz\" -- \"When I contradict myself, I am telling the truth.\"\nWe are the Renrijra Krin.  \"The Mercenary's Grin¸\" \"The Laugh of the Landless,\" and \"The Smiling Scum\" would all be fair translations.  It is a derogatory expression, but it is amusing so we have adopted it.\nWe have anger in our hearts, but not on our faces.  We fight for Elsweyr, but we do not ally ourselves with the Mane, who symbolizes our land.  We believe in justice, but do not follow laws.\n\"Q'zi no vano thzina ualizz.\"\nThese are not rules, for there is no word for \"rules\" in Ta'agra. Call them our \"thjizzrini\" -- \"foolish concepts.\"\n1. \"Vaba Do'Shurh'do\": \"It Is Good To Be Brave\"\nWe are struggling against impossible odds, against the very Empire of Tamriel.  Our cause is the noblest cause of all: defense of home.  If we fail, we betray our past and our future.  Our dead are \"Ri'sallidad\", which may be interpreted as \"martyrs\" in the truest, best sense of that word which is so often misused.  We honor their sacrifice and, beneath our smiles, mourn them deeply.\nOur bravery most obviously shows in the smile that is the \"Krin\" part of our name.  This does not mean that we walk about grinning like the idiotic, baboonish Imga of Valenwood.  We simply are entertained by adversary.  We find an equal, fair fight tiresome in the extreme.  We confidently smile because we know our victory in the end is assured.  And we know our smiles drive our enemies insane.\n2. \"Vaba Maaszi Lhajiito\": \"It Is Necessary To Run Away\"\nWe are struggling against impossible odds, against the very Empire of Tamriel.  Honor is madness.  Yes, we loved the Renrijra Krin who died in brave battle against the forces of the Empire, but I guarantee you that each of those Ri'sallidad had an escape route he or she failed to use, and died saying, \"Damn.\"\nWhen the great Senche-Raht comes to the Saimisil Steppes, he will find himself unable to hunt, unable to sleep, as the tiny Alfiq leap onto his back, biting him, and running off before he has a chance to turn his great body to face them.  Eventually, though he may stubbornly hope to catch the Alfiq, the Senche-Raht always leaves.  They are our cousins, the Alfiq, and we have adopted their strategy against the great tiger of Leyawiin.\nDo not ally yourself with the Renrij if you yearn to be part of a mighty army, marching resolutely forth, for whom retreat is anathema.  We will laugh at your suicidal idiocy as we slip into the reeds of the river, and watch the inevitable slaughter.\n3. \"Fusozay Var Var\": \"Enjoy Life\"\nLife is short.  If you have not made love recently, please, put down this book, and take care of that with all haste.  Find a wanton lass or a frisky lad, or several, in whatever combination your wise loins direct, and do not under any circumstances play hard to get.   Our struggle against the colossal forces of oppression can wait.\nGood.  Welcome back.\nWe Renrijra Krin live and fight together, and know that Leyawiin and the Empire will not give way very soon, likely not in our lifetimes.  In the time we have, we do not want our closest comrades to be dour, dull, colorless, sober, and virginal.  If we did, we would have joined the Emperor's Blades.\nDo not begrudge us our lewd jokes, our bawdy, drunken nights, our moonsugar.  They are the pleasures that Leyawiin denies us, and so we take our good humor very seriously.\n4. \"Fusozay Var Dar\": \"Kill Without Qualm\"\nLife is short.  Very short, as many have learned when they have crossed the Renrijra Krin.\nWe fight dirty.  If an enemy is facing us, we might consider our options, and even slip away if his sword looks too big.  If his back is to us, however, I personally favor knocking him down, and then jumping on his neck where the bones snap with a gratifying crunch.  Of course, it is up to you and your personal style.\n5. \"Ahzirr Durrarriss\": \"We Give Freely To The People\"\nLet us not forget our purpose.  We are fighting for our families, the Khajiiti driven from the rich, fertile shores of Lake Makapi and the River Malapi, where they and their ancestors lived since time immemorial.  It is our battle, but their tragedy.  We must show them, lest they are swayed by other rhetoric, that we are fighting for them.\nThe Mane, The Emperor, and The Count can give speeches, pass laws, and, living life in the open, explain their positions and philosophies to their people to stave off the inevitable revolution.  Extralegal entities, such as the Renrijra Krin, must make our actions count for our words.  This means more than fighting the good fight, and having a laugh at our befuddled adversaries.  It means engaging and seducing the people.  Ours is not a military war, it is a political war.  If the people rise up against our oppressors, they will retreat, and we will win.\nGive to these people, whenever possible, gold, moonsugar, and our strong arms, and though they hide, their hearts will be with us.\n6. \"Ahzirr Traajijazeri\": \"We Justly Take By Force\"\nLet us not forget our purpose.  We are thieves and thugs, smugglers and saboteurs.  If we cannot take a farm, we burn it to the ground.  If the Imperials garrisoned in a glorious ancient stronghold, beloved by our ancestors, will not yield, we tear the structure apart.  If the only way to rescue the land from the Leyawiin misappropriation is to make it uninhabitable by all, so be it.\nWe want our life and our home back as it was twenty years ago, but if that is not realistic, then we will accept a different simple, pragmatic goal.  Revenge.  With a smile."

I ent never rote a book before, and I do not reckon to rite one agenn, but sometimes a man must do what a man must do. And what I must do is set the recerd strate about the god called Akatosh and the dragon called Alduin. They ent the same thing, no matter what them Imperials mite say, or how thay mite wish it to be so.\nMy da was never one for the gods, but my ma was. She wershipped all the Divines, and tot me lots of things. So I noe a thing or two about Akatosh. Just as much as any Imperial. I noe he was the first of all the gods to take shape in the Beginning Place. And I noe he has the shape of a dragon.\nMy da even told me the story of Martyn Septim, and the things what happened when the gates to Oblivion opened. Septim turned into the spirit of Akatosh and killed Mehrunes Dagon. Now I dont noe about you, but any dragon that fites the Prince of Destruction is okay by me.\nNow I hope you understand the problim. Akatosh is good. Everyone, from Nord to Imperial, noes that. But Alduin? He ent good! He's the oposit of good! That Alduin is evil thrue and thrue. So you see, Akatosh and Alduin cant be one and the same.\nGrowing up as a lad in Skyrim, I herd all the stories. Told to me by my da, who was told by his da, who was told by his da, and so on. And one of those stories was about Alduin. But see, he was not Akatosh. He was another dragon and a real wun at that.\nAkatosh is some kind of spirit dragon I think, wen he bothers to be a dragon at all (and not a god livin in sum kind of god plac like Obliviun). But Alduin is a real dragon, with flesh and teeth and a mean streak longer than the White River. And there was a time when Alduin tried to rool over all of Skyrim with his other dragons. In the end, it took sum mitey strong heroes to finally kill Alduin and be dun with his hole sorry story.\nSo I got to ask - does that sound like Akatosh to you? No, frend. No it do not.\nAnd so I, Thromgar Iron-Head do firmly say, with the utmost connvicshun, that Alduin is real, and he ent Akatosh!"

    "text": "Amongst the Draugr\nby\nBernadette Bantien\nCollege of Winterhold\nIt wasn't until my seventh month with the creatures that they seemed to accept me. Well, \"accept\" isn't really the proper word, but they seemed to have decided that I posed no threat to them and gradually ceased their attacks. Though more than capable of fending them off (a combination of fire and turning spells are generally sufficient), I admit that I tired of having to be ever vigilant in their presence.\nI'll never know whether there was some sort of agreement communicated among them, for the only utterances they make seem to be in that heathen tongue that I can't even pronounce, much less transcribe. In time, I learned more of their intentions towards me from their general movements and tones rather than specific words. Hostility in any creature is easily read, but in these most peculiar of the living dead, with such variations in gait and speed, what amounts to a hostile charge in one may simply be casual movement in another. The eyes seem to be key to their intent, and I will confess to more than one dream haunted by the glowing pinpoints in the darkness.\nI had always wondered why the ancient priests of the dragon cult insisted that their followers be buried with them. It seems the height of pagan vanity to drag your conscripts to their death along with you, but as I integrated into their presence, I began to observe the reasons. Every day, a different set of draugr would awaken, shamble their way to the sarcophagus of their priest, and prostrate themselves before it. Several hours of this, followed by a meticulous cleaning of the area. It would appear that the adherents of the dragon priest continue their worship of him in death, which would also explain the ferocity with which they defend his chambers.\nIt took several weeks before I felt comfortable approaching the dragon priest's resting place, myself. Inch by inch, until the snarling draugrs around me seemed to tire of fending off my timid presence. I was able to set some simple scrying spells around the tomb, that I might get a sense of what magical energies resided there. When the next group of draugr came to pay homage to the priest, I noted a sort of transferal happening. A distinct flow of life force between the adherents and the master.\nIt was here that I finally understood the dragon cult's notion of resurrection. The second eternal life was only promised to those who ascended to the priesthood, but the lesser functionaries contributed their life force to sustaining them for eternity. I don't know what sort of eternal wellspring they draw from, but it's clear that each draugr carries only the barest whisper of life in it, and rekindles it nightly while resting in its niche. I now believe that the grotesque forms that we see in the barrows were, in fact, buried fully as men and women, and only over the thousands of years that have passed withered into the wretched things we know. If we had visited a barrow directly after its construction, we might not have even known any of its inhabitants were dead!\nThese discoveries and extrapolations excite me, and my mind aches to return to the barrows. I have only paused here at the College to transcribe these notes and gather further supplies for a more extended stay. My new hope is to learn some rudimentary way of speaking to them, for imagining what they could tell us of the early mists of time is staggering."

To my dismay, I discovered that the Moth Priests are notoriously inexact when it comes to the actual physical manifestations of the Scrolls, and had no idea how many they held, or how they were organized. Merely asking the question evoked chuckles, as if a child was asking why dogs cannot talk.\nI will confess, my jealousy of the ones who can read the Scrolls grows, but I am not yet willing to sacrifice my sight to alleged knowledge. The older Moth Priests I attempt to engage in conversation seem as batty as any other elder who has lost their mind, so I fail to see what wisdom is imparted from the reading.\nIn any case, I set out to create my own index of the Elder Scrolls, in cooperation with the monks. Day by day, we went through the tower halls, with them telling me the general nature of each Elder Scroll so that I might record its location. Always careful never to glimpse the writings myself, I had only their word to go on. I meticulously drew out a map of the chambers, where Scrolls relating to various specific prophecies were located, where particular periods of history were housed. In all, it took nearly a year of plodding, but at last I had rough notes on the entirety of the library to begin my collation.\nIt was here that things began to go amiss. In studying my notes, I found many areas of overlap and outright contradiction. In some cases different monks would claim the same scroll to be at opposite ends of the tower. I know they have no taste for jesting, or else I would suspect I was being made the fool in some game of theirs.\nI spoke to one of the older monks to relate my concerns, and he hung his head in sorrow for my wasted time. \"Did I not tell you,\" he coughed, \"when you started this that all efforts would be futile? The Scrolls do not exist in countable form.\"\n\"I had thought you meant there were too many to be counted.\"\n\"There are, but that is not the least of their complexities. Turn to the repository behind you, and tell me how many Scrolls are locked therein.\"\nI ran my fingers over the metal casings, tallying each rounded edge that they encountered. I turned back -- \"Fourteen,\" I said.\n\"Hand me the eighth one,\" he said, reaching out his hand.\nI guided the cylinder into his palm, and he gave a slight nod to acknowledge it. \"Now, count again.\"\nHumoring him, I again passed my hands over the Scrolls, but could not believe what I was feeling.\n\"Now... now there are eighteen!\" I gasped.\nThe old monk chuckled, his cheeks pushing up his blindfold until it folded over itself. \"And in fact,\" he said, \"there always were.\"\nIt was then that I enrolled as the oldest novice ever accepted into the Cult of the Ancestor Moth."

    "text": "An Explorer's Guide\nto Skyrim\nby\nMarcius Carvain,\nViscount Bruma\n\nFar too often, noble visitors from Cyrodiil see little more of Skyrim than the view from their carriage. To be sure, this coarse, uncivilized province is far from hospitable, but it is also a place of fierce, wild beauty, with grand vistas and inspiring natural wonders awaiting those with the will to seek them out and the refinement to truly appreciate them. If you are of a mind to see Skyrim for yourself, I recommend beginning your adventure as I did, by seeking out Stones of Fate.\nNo doubt you are taken aback by the name, as I once was. The provincials and village folk have all manner of dark tales about these ancient monuments. Stories of necromantic rituals and fell spirits, of great and terrible powers conferred on any who dare to touch them.\nThe stories are, as Jarl Igrof once told me, \"A load of mammoth dung.\" A bit uncouth, but you get the point.\nTo be sure, keep your guards with you at all times - brigands and wild animals are never to be taken lightly. But the stones themselves are nothing to fear. Quite the contrary, their proximity to cities and roads makes them ideal destinations for the novice explorer, and many boast spectacular views that make the journey well worth the effort.\nTo whet your appetite, here are four such locations:\nMost travelers enter Skyrim by way of Helgen, \"Gateway to the North.\" If you find yourself in this backwater hovel, consider taking an afternoon's ride to the north, keeping to the road as it winds down the cliffs at the eastern end of Lake Ilinalta. Just off the path, on a small bluff, lie the three Guardian Stones, the greatest concentration of standing stones in all Skyrim. The view of the lake here at sunset is simply sublime.\nVisitors from Cheydinhal will pass through Riften, city of intrigue and larceny since Tiber Septim's day. If you seek adventure in the Rift, leave the city by the southern gate and cast your gaze upon the bluff that rises to the south. Atop it sits the Shadow Stone, a fitting symbol for the city of thieves.\nWhiterun is the heart of Skyrim, its towering palace rivaling even the great castles of Cyrodiil. But should you tire of the Jarl's hospitality, another adventure awaits a few hours to the east of the city, along the road that rises above White River Gorge. The Ritual Stone can be found atop the lone hill that rises on the north side of the road, set into an ancient monument. Take time to soak in the incredible view of Whiterun, the tundra, and the gorge from this unique spot.\nMore seasoned explorers may wish to visit Markarth, the ancient city of stone far to the west. The recent Forsworn Rebellion has made travel in the Reach perilous, but for those determined to seek adventure no matter the cost,  another stone can be found to the east of the city, perched on the mountain above Kolskeggr Mine. Though the climb is difficult, reaching the summit is a milestone any explorer could be proud of.\nThere are other Stones of Fate to be found in Skyrim - I myself have seen several more, perched on the most remote mountain peaks, or wreathed in fog amid the northern marshes. But the true joy of exploration is in the discovery, and so I leave the rest to you. May the Eight guide your steps."

    "text": "Editor's Note:\n\tBrother Hetchfeld is an Associate Scribe at the Imperial University, Office of Introductory Studies\nGods are commonly judged upon the evidence of their interest in worldly matters. A central belief in the active participation of Deities in mundane matters can be challenged by the reference to apparent apathy and indifference on the part of Gods during times of plague or famine.\nFrom intervention in legendary quests to manifestations in common daily life, no pattern for the Gods of Tamriel activities is readily perceived. The concerns of Gods in many ways may seem unrelated or at best unconcerned with the daily trials of the mortal realm. The exceptions do exist, however.\nMany historical records and legends point to the direct intervention of one or more gods at times of great need. Many heroic tales recount blessings of the divinity bestowed upon heroic figures who worked or quested for the good of a Deity or the Deity's temple. Some of the more powerful artifacts in the known world were originally bestowed upon their owners through such reward. It has also been reported that priests of high ranking in their temples may on occasion call upon their Deity for blessings or help in time of need. The exact nature of such contact and the blessings bestowed is given to much speculation, as the temples hold such associations secret and holy. This direct contact gives weight to the belief that the Gods are aware of the mortal realm. In many circumstances, however, these same Gods will do nothing in the face of suffering and death, seeming to feel no need to interfere. It is thus possible to conclude that we, as mortals, may not be capable of understanding more than a small fraction of the reasoning and logic such beings use.\nOne defining characteristic of all Gods and Goddesses is their interest in worship and deeds. Deeds in the form of holy quests are just one of the many things that bring the attention of a Deity. Deeds in everyday life, by conforming to the statutes and obligations of individual temples are commonly supposed to please a Deity. Performance of ceremony in a temple may also bring a Deity's attention. Ceremonies vary according to the individual Deity. The results are not always apparent but sacrifice and offerings are usually required to have any hope of gaining a Deity's attention.\nWhile direct intervention in daily temple life has been recorded, the exact nature of the presence of a God in daily mundane life is a subject of controversy. A traditional saying of the Wood Elves is that \"One man's miracle is another man's accident.\" While some gods are believed to take an active part of daily life, others are well known for their lack of interest in temporal affairs.\nIt has been theorized that gods do in fact gain strength from such things as worship through praise, sacrifice and deed. It may even be theorized that the number of worshippers a given Deity has may reflect on His overall position among the other Gods. This my own conjecture, garnered from the apparent ability of the larger temples to attain blessings and assistance from their God with greater ease than smaller religious institutions.\nThere are reports of the existence of spirits in our world that have the same capacity to use the actions and deeds of mortals to strengthen themselves as do the Gods. The understanding of the exact nature of such creatures would allow us to understand with more clarity the connection between a Deity and the Deity's worshipers.\nThe implication of the existence of such spirits leads to the speculation that these spirits may even be capable of raising themselves to the level of a God or Goddess. Motusuo of the Imperial Seminary has suggested that these spirits may be the remains of Gods and Goddesses who through time lost all or most of their following, reverting to their earliest most basic form. Practioners of the Old Ways say that there are no Gods, just greater and lesser spirits. Perhaps it is possible for all three theories to be true."

    "text": "Ghosts Walk Among Them\nThe departed spirits of the Dunmeri, and perhaps those of all races, persist after death. The knowledge and power of departed ancestors benefits the bloodlines of Dunmeri Houses. The bond between the living family members and immortal ancestors is partly blood, partly ritual, partly volitional. A member brought into the House through marriage binds himself through ritual and oath into the clan, and gains communication and benefits from the clan's ancestors; however, his access to the ancestors is less than his offspring, and he retains some access to the ancestors of his own bloodline.\nThe Family Shrine\nEach residence has a family shrine. In poorer homes, it may be no more than a hearth or alcove where family relics are displayed and venerated. In wealthy homes, a room is set aside for the use of the ancestors. This shrine is called the Waiting Door, and represents the door to Oblivion.\nHere the family members pay their respects to their ancestors through sacrifice and prayer, through oaths sworn upon duties, and through reports on the affairs of the family. In return, the family may receive information, training, and blessings from the family's ancestors. The ancestors are thus the protectors of the home, and especially the precincts of the Waiting Door.\nThe Ghost Fence\nIt is a family's most solemn duty to make sure their ancestor's remains are interred properly in a City of the Dead such as Necrom. Here the spirits draw comfort from one another against the chill of the mortal world. However, as a sign of great honor and sacrifice, an ancestor may grant that part of his remains be retained to serve as part of a ghost fence protecting the clan's shrine and family precincts. Such an arrangement is often part of the family member's will, that a knucklebone shall be saved out of his remains and incorporated with solemn magic and ceremony into a clan ghost fence. In more exceptional cases, an entire skeleton or even a preserved corpse may be bound into a ghost fence.\nThese remains become a beacon and focus for ancestral spirits, and for the spirit of the remains in particular. The more remains used to make a ghost fence, the more powerful the fence is. And the most powerful mortals in life have the most powerful remains.\nThe Great Ghost Fence created by the Tribunal to hold back the Blight incorporates the bones of many heroes of the Temple and of the Houses Indoril and Redoran who dedicated their spirits to the Temple and Clan as their surrogate families. The Ghost Fence also contains bones taken from the Catacombs of Necrom and the many battlefields of Morrowind.\nThe Mortal Chill\nSpirits do not like to visit the mortal world, and they do so only out of duty and obligation. Spirits tell us that the otherworld is more pleasant, or at least more comfortable for spirits than our real world, which is cold, bitter, and full of pain and loss.\nMad Spirits\nSpirits that are forced to remain in our world against their will may become mad spirits, or ghosts.\nSome spirits are bound to this world because of some terrible circumstances of their death, or because of some powerful emotional bond to a person, place, or thing. These are called hauntings.\nSome spirits are captured and bound to enchanted items by wizards. If the binding is involuntary, the spirit usually goes mad. A willing spirit may or may not retain its sanity, depending on the strength of the spirit and the wisdom of the enchanter.\nSome spirits are bound against their wills to protect family shrines. This unpleasant fate is reserved for those who have not served the family faithfully in life. Dutiful and honorable ancestral spirits often aid in the capture and binding of wayward spirits.\nThese spirits usually go mad, and make terrifying guardians. They are ritually prevented from harming mortals of their clans, but that does not necessary discourage them from mischievous or peevish behavior."

    "text": "Ancient Tales of the Dwemer, part I: The Ransom of Zarek\nThe Ransom of Zarek\n\tAncient Tales of the Dwemer\n\tPart I\nby\n\tMarobar Sul\nJalemmil stood in her garden and read the letter her servant had brought to her. The bouquet of joss roses in her hand fell to the ground. For a moment it was as if all birds had ceased to sing and a cloud had passed over the sky. Her carefully cultivated and structured haven seemed to flood over with darkness.\n\"We have thy son,\" it read. \"We will be in touch with thee shortly with our ransom demands.\"\nZarek had never made it as far as Akgun after all. One of the brigands on the road, Orcs probably, or accursed Dunmer, must have seen his well-appointed carriage, and taken him hostage. Jalemmil clutched at a post for support, wondering if her boy had been hurt. He was but a student, not the sort to fight against well-armed men, but had they beaten him? It was more than a mother's heart could bear to imagine.\n\"Don't tell me they sent the ransom note so quickly,\" called a family voice, and a familiar face appeared through the hedge. It was Zarek. Jalemmil hurried to embrace her boy, tears running down her face.\n\"What happened?\" she cried. \"I thought thou had been kidnapped.\"\n\"I was,\" said Zarek. \"Three huge soaring Nords attacked by carriage on the Frimvorn Pass. Brothers, as I learned, named Mathais, Ulin, and Koorg. Thou should have seen these men, mother. Each one of them would have had trouble fitting through the front door, I can tell thee.\"\n\"What happened?\" Jalemmil repeated. \"Were thou rescued?\"\n\"I thought about waiting for that, but I knew they'd send off a ransom note and I know how thou does worry. So I remembered what my mentor at Akgun always said about remaining calm, observing thy surroundings, and looking for thy opponent's weakness,\" Zarek grinned. \"It took a while, though, because these fellows were truly monsters. And then, when I listened to them, bragging to one another, I realized that vanity was their weakness.\"\n\"What did thou do?\"\n\"They had me chained at their camp in the woods not far from Cael, on a high knoll over-looking a wide river. I heard one of them, Koorg, telling the others that it would take the better part of an hour to swim across the river and back. They were nodding in agreement, when I spoke up.\n\"'I could swim that river and back in thirty minutes,' I said.\n\"'Impossible,' said Koorg. 'I can swim faster than a little whelp like thee.'\n\"So it was agreed that we would dive off the cliff, swim to the center island, and return. As we went to our respective rocks, Koorg took it upon himself to lecture me about all the fine points of swimming. The importance of synchronized movements of the arms and legs for maximum speed. How essential it was to breathe after only third or fourth stroke, not too often to slow thyself down, but not too often to lose one's air. I nodded and agreed to all his fine points. Then we dove off the cliffs. I made it to the island and back in a little over an hour, but Koorg never returned. He had dashed his brains at the rocks at the base of the cliff. I had noticed the telltale undulations of underwater rocks, and had taken the diving rock on the right.\"\n\"But thou returned?\" asked Jalemmil, astounded. \"Was that not then when thou escaped?\"\n\"It was too risky to escape then,\" said Zarek. \"They could have easily caught me again, and I wasn't keen to be blamed for Koorg's disappearance. I said I did not know what happened to him, and after some searching, they decided he had forgotten about the race and had swum ashore to hunt for food. They could not see how I could have had anything to do with his disappearance, as fully visible as I was throughout my swim. The two brothers began making camp along the rocky cliff-edge, picking an ideal location so that I would not be able to escape.\n\"One of the brothers, Mathais, began commenting on the quality of the soil and the gradual incline of the rock that circled around the bay below. Ideal, he said, for a foot race. I expressed my ignorance of the sport, and he was keen to give me details of the proper technique for running a race. He made absurd faces, showing how one must breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth; how to bend one's knees to the proper angle on the rise; the importance of sure foot placement. Most important, he explained, was that the runner keep an aggressive but not too strenuous pace if one intends to win. It is fine to run in second place through the race, he said, provided one has the willpower and strength to pull out in the end.\n\"I was an enthusiastic student, and Mathais decided that we ought to run a quick race around the edge of the bay before night fell. Ulin told us to bring back some firewood when we came back. We began at once down the path, skirting the cliff below. I followed his advice about breath, gait, and foot placement, but I ran with all my power right from the start. Despite his much longer legs, I was a few paces ahead as we wound the first corner.\n\"With his eyes on my back, Mathais did not see the gape in the rock that I jumped over. He plummeted over the cliff before he had a chance to cry out. I spent a few minutes gathering some twigs before I returned to Ulin at camp.\"\n\"Now thou were just showing off,\" frowned Jalemmil. \"Surely that would have been a good time to escape.\"\n\"Thou might think so,\" agreed Zarek. \"But thou had to see the topography -- a few large trees, and then nothing but shrubs. Ulin would have noticed my absence and caught up with me in no time, and I would have had a hard time explaining Mathais's absence. However, the brief forage around the area allowed me to observe some of the trees close up, and I could formulate my final plan.\n\"When I got back to camp with a few twigs, I told Ulin that Mathais was slow coming along, dragging a large dead tree behind him. Ulin scoffed at his brother's strength, saying it would take him time to pull up a live tree by the roots and drop it on the bonfire. I expressed reasonable doubt.\n\"'I'll show thee,' he said, ripping up a ten foot tall specimen effortlessly.\n\"'But that's scarcely a sapling,' I objected. 'I thought thou could rip up a tree.' His eyes followed mine to a magnificent, heavy-looking one at the edge of the clearing. Ulin grabbed it and began to shake it with a tremendous force to loosen its roots from the dirt. With that, he loosened the hive from the uppermost branches, dropping it down onto his head.\n\"That was when I made my escape, mother,\" said Zarek, in conclusion, showing a little schoolboy pride. \"While Mathais and Koorg were at the base of the cliff, and Ulin was flailing about, engulfed by a swarm.\"\nJalemmil embraced her son once again.\n\nPublisher's Note\n\tI was reluctant to publish the works of Marobar Sul, but when the University of Gwylim Press asked me to edit this edition, I decided to use this as an opportunity to set the record straight once and for all.\nScholars do not agree on the exact date of Marobar Sul's work, but it is generally agreed that they were written by the playwright \"Gor Felim,\" famous for popular comedies and romances during the Interregnum between the fall of the First Cyrodilic Empire and the rise of Tiber Septim. The current theory holds that Felim heard a few genuine Dwemer tales and adapted them to the stage in order to make money, along with rewritten versions of many of his own plays.\nGor Felim created the persona of \"Marobar Sul\" who could translate the Dwemer language in order to add some sort of validity to the work and make it even more valuable to the gullible. Note that while \"Marobar Sul\" and his works became the subject of heated controversy, there are no reliable records of anyone actually meeting \"Marobar Sul,\" nor was there anyone of that name employed by the Mages Guild, the School of Julianos, or any other intellectual institution.\nIn any case, the Dwemer in most of the tales of \"Marobar Sul\" bear little resemblance to the fearsome, unfathomable race that frightened even the Dunmer, Nords, and Redguards into submission and built ruins that even now have yet to be understood.\n\nAncient Tales of the Dwemer, part II: The Seed\nThe Seed\n\tAncient Tales of the Dwemer\n\tPart II\nby\n\tMarobar Sul\nThe hamlet village of Lorikh was a quiet, peaceful Dwemer community nestled in the monochrome grey and tan dunes and boulders of the Dejasyte. No vegetation of any kind grew in Lorikh, though there were blackened vestiges of long dead trees scattered throughout the town. Kamdida arriving by caravan looked at her new home with despair. She was used to the forestland of the north where her father's family had haled. Here there was no shade, little water, and a great open sky. It looked like a dead land.\nHer mother's family took Kamdida and her younger brother Nevith in, and was very kind to the orphans, but she felt lonely in the alien village. It was not until she met an old Argonian woman who worked at the water factory that Kamdida found a friend. Her name was Sigerthe, and she said that her family had lived in Lorikh centuries before the Dwemer arrived, when it was a great and beauteous forest.\n\"Why did the trees die?\" asked Kamdida.\n\"When there were Argonians only in this land, we never cut trees for we had no need for fuel or wooden structures such as you use. When the Dwemer came, we allowed them to use the plants as they needed them, provided they never touched the Hist, which are sacred to us and to the land. For many years, we lived peaceably. No one wanted for anything.\"\n\"What happened?\"\n\"Some of your scientists discovered that distilling a certain tree sap, molding it and drying it, they could create a resilient kind of armor called resin,\" said Sigerthe. \"Most of the trees that grew here had very thin ichor in their branches, but not the Hist. Many of them fairly glistened with sap, which made the Dwemer merchants greedy. They hired a woodsman named Juhnin to start clearing the sacred arbors for profit.\"\nThe old Argonian woman looked to the dusty ground and sighed, \"Of course, we Argonians cried out against it. It was our home, and the Hist, once gone, would never return. The merchants reconsidered, but Juhnin took it on his own to break our spirit. He proved one terrible, bloody day that his prodigious skill with the axe could be used against people as well as trees. Any Argonian who stood in his way was hewn asunder, children as well. The Dwemer people of Lorikh closed their doors and their ears to the cries of murder.\"\n\"Horrible,\" gasped Kamdida.\n\"It is difficult to explain,\" said Sigerthe. \"But the deaths of our living ones was not nearly as horrible to us as the death of our trees. You must understand that to my people, the Hist are where we come from and where we are going. To destroy our bodies is nothing; to destroy our trees is to annihilate us utterly. When Juhnin then turned his axe on the Hist, he killed the land. The water disappeared, the animals died, and all the other life that the trees nourished crumbled and dried to dust.\"\n\"But you are still here?\" asked Kamdida. \"Why didn't you leave?\"\n\"For us, we are trapped. I am one of the last of a dying people. Few of us are strong enough to live away from our ancestral groves, and sometimes, even now, there is a perfume in the air of Lorikh that gives us life. It will not be long until we are all gone.\"\nKamdida felt tears welling up in her eyes. \"Then I will be alone in this horrible place with no trees and no friends.\"\n'We Argonians have an expression,\" said Sigerthe with a sad smile, taking Kamdida's hand. \"That the best soil for a seed is found in your heart.\"\nKamdida looked into the palm of her hand and saw that Sigerthe had given her a small black pellet. It was a seed. \"It looks dead.\"\n\"It can only grow in one place in all Lorikh,\" said the old Argonian. \"Outside an old cottage in the hills outside town. I cannot go there, for the owner would kill me on sight and like all my people, I am too frail to defend myself now. But you can go there and plant the seed.\"\n\"What will happen?\" asked Kamdida. \"Will the Hist return?\"\n\"No. But some part of their power will.\"\nThat night, Kamdida stole from her house and into the hills. She knew the cottage Sigerthe had spoken of. Her aunt and uncle had told her never to go there. As she approached it, the door opened and an old but powerfully built man appeared, a mighty axe slung over his shoulder.\n\"What are you doing here, child?\" he demanded. \"In the dark, I almost took you to be a lizard man.\"\n\"I've lost my way in the dark,\" she said quickly. \"I'm trying to get back to my home in Lorikh.\"\n\"Be on your way then.\"\n\"Do you have a candle I might have?\" she asked piteously. \"I've been walking in circles and I'm afraid I'll only return back here without any light.\"\nThe old man grumbled and walked into his house. Quickly, Kamdida dug a hole in the dry dirt and buried the seed as deeply as she could. He returned with a lit candle.\n\"See to it you don't come back here,\" he growled. \"Or I'll chop you in half.\"\nHe returned to his house and fire. The next morning when he awoke and opened the door, he found that his cottage was entirely sealed within an enormous tree. He picked up his axe and delivered blow and after blow to the wood, but he could never break through. He tried side chops, but the wood healed itself. He tried an upper chop followed by an under chop to form a wedge, but the wood sealed.\nMuch time went by before someone discovered old Juhnin's emaciated body lying in front of his open door, still holding his blunted, broken axe. It was a mystery to all what he had been chopping with it, but the legend began circulating through Lorikh that Hist sap was found on the blade.\nShortly thereafter, small desert flowers began pushing through the dry dirt in the town. Trees and plants newly sown began to live tolerably well, if not luxuriantly. The Hist did not return, but Kamdida and the people of Lorikh noticed that at a certain time around twilight, long, wide shadows of great, bygone trees would fill the streets and hills.\nPublisher's Note\n\t\"The Seed\" is one of Marobar Sul's tales whose origins are well known. This tale originated from the Argonian slaves of southern Morrowind. \"Marobar Sul\" merely replaced the Dunmer with Dwemer and claimed he found it in a Dwemer ruin. Furthermore, he later claimed that the Argonian version of the tale was merely a retelling of his \"original!\"\nLorikh, while clearly not a Dwemer name, simply does not exist, and in fact \"Lorikh\" was a name commonly used, incorrectly, for Dunmer men in Gor Felim's plays. The Argonian versions of the story usually take place on Vvardenfell, usually in the Telvanni city of Sadrith Mora. Of course the so-called \"scholars\" of Temple Zero will probably claim this story has something to do with \"Lorkhan\" simply because the town starts with the letter L.\n\nAncient Tales of the Dwemer, part III: The Importance of Where\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF WHERE\nAncient Tales of\n\tthe Dwemer, Part III\nBy\n\tMarobar Sul\nThe chieftain of Othrobar gathered his wise men together and said, \"Every morning a tenfold of my flock are found butchered. What is the cause?\"\nFangbith the Warleader said, \"A Monster may be coming down from the Mountain and devouring your flock.\"\nGhorick the Healer said, \"A strange new disease perhaps is to blame.\"\nBeran the Priest said, \"We must sacrifice to the Goddess for her to save us.\"\nThe wise men made sacrifices, and while they waited for their answers from the Goddess, Fangbith went to Mentor Joltereg and said, \"You taught me well how to forge the cudgel of Zolia, and how to wield it in combat, but I must know now when it is wise to use my skill. Do I wait for the Goddess to reply, or the medicine to work, or do I hunt the Monster which I know is in the Mountain?\"\n\"When is not important,\" said Joltereg. \"Where is all that is important.\"\nSo Fangbith took his Zolic cudgel in hand and walked far through the dark forest until he came to the base of the Great Mountain. There he met two Monsters. One bloodied with the flesh of the chieftain of Othrobar's flock fought him while its mate fled. Fangbith remembered what his master had taught him, that \"where\" was all that was important.\nHe struck the Monster on each of its five vital points: head, groin, throat, back, and chest. Five blows to the five points and the Monster was slain. It was too heavy to carry with him, but still triumphant, Fangbith returned to Othrobar.\n\"I say I have slain the Monster that ate your flock,\" he cried.\n\"What proof have you that you have slain any Monster?\" asked the chieftain.\n\"I say I have saved the flock with my medicine,\" said Ghorick the Healer.\n\"I say The Goddess has saved the flock by my sacrifices,\" said Beran the Priest.\nTwo mornings went by and the flocks were safe, but on the morning of the third day, another tenfold of the chieftain's flock was found butchered. Ghorick the Healer went to his study to find a new medicine. Beran the Priest prepared more sacrifices. Fangbith took his Zolic cudgel in hand, again, and walked far through the dark forest until he came to the base of the Great Mountain. There he met the other Monster, bloodied with the flesh of the chieftain of Othrobar's flock. They did battle, and again Fangbith remembered what his master had taught him, that \"where\" was all that was important.\nHe struck the Monster five times on the head and it fled. Chasing it along the mountain, he struck it five times in the groin and it fled. Running through the forest, Fangbith overtook the Monster and struck it five times in the throat and it fled. Entering into the fields of Othrobar, Fangbith overtook the Monster and struck it five times in the back and it fled. At the foot of the stronghold, the chieftain and his wise men emerged to the sound of the Monster wailing. There they beheld the Monster that had slain the chieftain's flock. Fangbith struck the Monster five times in the chest and it was slain.\nA great feast was held in Fangbith's honor, and the flock of Othrobar was never again slain. Joltereg embraced his student and said, \"You have at last learned the importance of where you strike your blows.\"\nPublisher's Note\n\tThis tale is another, which has an obvious origin among the Ashlander tribes of Vvardenfell and is one of their oldest tales. \"Marobar Sul\" merely changed the names of the character to sound more \"Dwarven\" and resold it as part of his collection. The Great Mountain in the tale is clearly \"Red Mountain,\" despite its description of being forested. The Star-Fall and later eruptions destroyed the vegetation on Red Mountain, giving it the wasted appearance it has today.\nThis tale does have some scholarly interest, as it suggests a primitive Ashlander culture, but it talks of living in \"strongholds\" much like the ruined strongholds on Vvardenfell today. There are even references to a stronghold of \"Othrobar\" somewhere between Vvardenfell and Skyrim, but few strongholds outside of sparsely-settled Vvardenfell have survived to the present. Scholars do not agree on who built these strongholds or when, but I believe it is clear from this story and other evidence that the Ashlander tribes used these strongholds in the ancient past instead of making camps of wickwheat huts as they do today.\nThe play on words that forms the lesson of the fable -- that it is as important to know where the monster should be slain, at the stronghold, as it is to know where the monster must be struck on its body to be slain -- is typical of many Ashlander tales. Riddles, even ones as simple as this one, are loved by both the Ashlanders and the vanished Dwemer. Although the Dwemer are usually portrayed as presenting the riddles, rather than being the ones who solve it as in Ashlander tales.\n\nAncient Tales of the Dwemer, part V: Song of the Alchemists\nThe Song of the Alchemists\n\tAncient Tales of the Dwemer\n\tPart V\nBy\n\tMarobar Sul\nWhen King Maraneon's alchemist had to leave his station\n\tAfter a laboratory experiment that yielded detonation,\n\tThe word went out that the King did want\n\tA new savant\n\tTo mix his potions and brews.\n\tBut he declared he would only choose\n\tA fellow who knew the tricks and the tools.\n\tThe King refused to hire on more fools.\nAfter much deliberation, discussions, and debates,\n\tThe King picked two well-learned candidates.\n\tIanthippus Minthurk and Umphatic Faer,\n\tAn ambitious pair,\n\tVied to prove which one was the best.\n\tSaid the King, \"There will be a test.\"\n\tThey went to a large chamber with herbs, gems, tomes,\n\tPots, measuring cups, all under high crystalline domes.\n\"Make me a tonic that will make me invisible,\"\n\tLaughed the King in a tone some would call risible.\n\tSo Umphatic Faer and Ianthippus Minthurk\n\tBegan to work,\n\tMincing herbs, mashing metal, refining strange oils,\n\tCautiously setting their cauldrons to burbling boils,\n\tEach on his own, sending mixing bowls mixing,\n\tSometimes peeking to see what the other was fixing.\nAfter they had worked for nearly three-quarters an hour,\n\tBoth Ianthippus Minthurk and Umphatic Faer\n\tWinked at the other, certain he won.\n\tSaid King Maraneon,\n\t\"Now you must taste the potions you've wrought,\n\tTake a spoon and sample it right from your pot.\"\n\tMinthurk vanished as his lips touched his brew,\n\tBut Faer tasted his and remained apparent in view.\n\"You think you mixed silver, blue diamonds, and yellow grass!\"\n\tThe King laughed, \"Look up, Faer, up to the ceiling glass.\n\tThe light falling makes the ingredients you choose\n\tQuite different hues.\"\n\t\"What do you get,\" asked the floating voice, bold,\n\t\"Of a potion of red diamonds, blue grass, and gold?\"\n\t\"By [Dwemer God],\" said Faer, his face in a wince,\n\t\"I've made a potion to fortify my own intelligence.\"\nPublisher's Note:\nThis poetry is so clearly in the style of Gor Felim that it really does not need any commentary. Note the simple rhyming scheme of AA/BB/CC, the sing-song but purposefully clumsy meter, and the recurring jokes at the obviously absurd names, Umphatic Faer and Ianthippus Minthurk. The final joke that the stupid alchemist invents a potion to make himself smarter by pure accident would have appealed to the anti-intellectualism of audiences in the Interregnum period, but would certainly be rejected by the Dwemer.\nNote that even \"Marobar Sul\" refuses to name any Dwemer gods. The Dwemer religion, if it can even be called that, is one of the most complex and difficult puzzles of their culture.\nOver the millennia, the song became a popular tavern song in High Rock before eventually disappearing from everything but scholarly books. Much like the Dwemer themselves.\n\nAncient Tales of the Dwemer, part VI: Chimarvamidium\nChimarvamidium:\n\tAncient Tales of the Dwemer\n\tPart VI\nBy\n\tMarobar Sul\nAfter many battles, it was clear who would win the War. The Chimer had great skills in magick and bladery, but against the armored battalions of the Dwemer, clad in the finest shielding wrought by Jnaggo, there was little hope of their ever winning. In the interests of keeping some measure of peace in the Land, Sthovin the Warlord agreed to a truce with Karenithil Barif the Beast. In exchange for the Disputed Lands, Sthovin gave Barif a mighty golem, which would protect the Chimer's territory from the excursions of the Northern Barbarians.\nBarif was delighted with his gift and brought it back to his camp, where all his warriors gaped in awe at it. Sparkling gold in hue, it resembled a Dwemer cavalier with a proud aspect. To test its strength, they placed the golem in the center of an arena and flung magickal bolts of lightning at it. Its agility was such that few of the bolts struck it. It had the wherewithal to pivot on its hips to avoid the brunt of the attacks without losing its balance, feet firmly planted on the ground. A vault of fireballs followed, which the golem ably dodged, bending its knees and its legs to spin around the blasts. The few times it was struck, it made certain to be hit in the chest and waist, the strongest parts of its body.\nThe troops cheered at the sight of such an agile and powerful creation. With it leading the defense, the Barbarians of Skyrim would never again successfully raid their villages. They named it Chimarvamidium, the Hope of the Chimer.\nBarif has the golem brought to his chambers with all his housethanes. There they tested Chimarvamidium further, its strength, its speed, its resiliency. They could find no flaw with its design.\n\"Imagine when the naked barbarians first meet this on one of their raids,\" laughed one of the housethanes.\n\"It is only unfortunate that it resembles a Dwemer instead of one of our own,\" mused Karenithil Barif. \"It is revolting to think that they will have a greater respect for our other enemies than us.\"\n\"I think we should never accepted the peace terms that we did,\" said another, one of the most aggressive of the housethanes. \"Is it too late to surprise the warlord Sthovin with an attack?\"\n\"It is never too late to attack,\" said Barif. \"But what of his great armored warriors?\"\n\"I understand,\" said Barif's spymaster. \"That his soldiers always wake at dawn. If we strike an hour before, we can catch them defenseless, before they've had a chance to bathe, let alone don their armor.\"\n\"If we capture their armorer Jnaggo, then we too would know the secrets of blacksmithery,\" said Barif. \"Let it be done. We attack tomorrow, an hour before dawn.\"\nSo it was settled. The Chimer army marched at night, and swarmed into the Dwemer camp. They were relying on Chimarvamidium to lead the first wave, but it malfunctioned and began attacking the Chimer's own troops. Added to that, the Dwemer were fully armored, well-rested, and eager for battle. The surprise was turned, and most of the high-ranking Chimer, including Karenithil Barif the Beast, were captured.\nThough they were too proud to ask, Sthovin explained to them that he had been warned of their attack by a Calling by one of his men.\n\"What man of yours is in our camp?\" sneered Barif.\nChimarvamidium, standing erect by the side of the captured, removed its head. Within its metal body was Jnaggo, the armorer.\n\"A Dwemer child of eight can create a golem,\" he explained. \"But only a truly great warrior and armorer can pretend to be one.\"\nPublisher's Note:\n\tThis is one of the few tales in this collection, which can actually be traced to the Dwemer. The wording of the story is quite different from older versions in Aldmeris, but the essence is the same. \"Chimarvamidium\" may be the Dwemer \"Nchmarthurnidamz.\" This word occurs several times in plans of Dwemer armor and Animunculi, but it's meaning is not known. It is almost certainly not \"Hope of the Chimer,\" however.\nThe Dwemer were probably the first to use heavy armors. It is important to note how a man dressed in armor could fool many of the Chimer in this story. Also note how the Chimer warriors react. When this story was first told, armor that covered the whole body must have still been uncommon and new, whereas even then, Dwemer creations like golems and centurions were well known.\nIn a rare scholarly moment, Marobar Sul leaves a few pieces of the original story intact, such as parts of the original line in Aldmeris, \"A Dwemer of eight can create a golem, but an eight of Dwemer can become one.\"\nAnother aspect of this legend that scholars like myself find interesting is the mention of \"the Calling.\" In this legend and in others, there is a suggestion that the Dwemer race as a whole had some sort of silent and magickal communication. There are records of the Psijic Order which suggest they, too, share this secret. Whatever the case, there are no documented spells of \"calling.\" The Cyrodiil historian Borgusilus Malier first proposed this as a solution to the disappearance of the Dwemer. He theorized that in 1E 668, the Dwemer enclaves were called together by one of their powerful philosopher-sorcerers (\"Kagrnak\" in some documents) to embark on a great journey, one of such sublime profundity that they abandoned all their cities and lands to join the quest to foreign climes as an entire culture.\nAncient Tales of the Dwemer, part X: The Dowry\nThe Dowry\n\tAncient Tales\n\tof the Dwemer\n\tPart X\nby\n\tMarobar Sul\nYnaleigh was the wealthiest landowner in Gunal, and he had over the years saved a tremendous dowry for the man who would marry his daughter, Genefra. When she reached the age of consent, he locked the gold away for safe-keeping, and announced his intention to have her marry. She was a comely lass, a scholar, a great athlete, but dour and brooding in aspect. This personality defect did not bother her potential suitors any more than her positive traits impressed them. Every man knew the tremendous wealth that would be his as the husband of Genefra and son-in-law of Ynaleigh. That alone was enough for hundreds to come to Gunal to pay court.\n\"The man who will marry my daughter,\" said Ynaleigh to the assembled. \"Must not be doing so purely out of avarice. He must demonstrate his own wealth to my satisfaction.\"\nThis simple pronouncement removed a vast majority of the suitors, who knew they could not impress the landowner with their meager fortunes. A few dozen did come forward within a few days, clad in fine killarc cloth of spun silver, accompanied by exotic servants, traveling in magnificent carriages. Of all who came who met with Ynaleigh's approval, none arrived in a more resplendent fashion that Welyn Naerillic. The young man, who no one had ever heard of, arrived in a shining ebon coach drawn by a team of dragons, his clothing of rarest manufacture, and accompanied by an army of the most fantastical servants any of Gunal had ever seen. Valets with eyes on all sides of their heads, maidservants that seemed cast in gemstones.\nBut such was not enough with Ynaleigh.\n\"The man who marries my daughter must prove himself a intelligent fellow, for I would not have an ignoramus as a son-in-law and business partner,\" he declared.\nThis eliminated a large part of the wealthy suitors, who, through their lives of luxury, had never needed to think very much if at all. Still some came forward over the next few days, demonstrating their wit and learning, quoting the great sages of the past and offering their philosophies of metaphysics and alchemy. Welyn Naerillic too came and asked Ynaleigh to dine at the villa he had rented outside of Gunal. There the landowner saw scores of scribes working on translations of Aldmeri tracts, and enjoyed the young man's somewhat irreverent but intriguing intelligence.\nNevertheless, though he was much impressed with Welyn Naerillic, Ynaleigh had another challenge.\n\"I love my daughter very much,\" said Ynaleigh. \"And I hope that the man who marries her will make her happy as well. Should any of you make her smile, she and the great dowry are yours.\"\nThe suitors lined up for days, singing her songs, proclaiming their devotion, describing her beauty in the most poetic of terms. Genefra merely glared at all with hatred and melancholia. Ynaleigh who stood by her side began to despair at last. His daughter's suitors were failing to a man at this task. Finally Welyn Naerillic came to the chamber.\n\"I will make your daughter smile,\" he said. \"I dare say, I'll make her laugh, but only after you've agreed to marry us. If she is not delighted within one hour of our engagement, the wedding can be called off.\"\nYnaleigh turned to his daughter. She was not smiling, but her eyes had sparked with some morbid curiosity in this young man. As no other suitor had even registered that for her, he agreed.\n\"The dowry is naturally not to be paid 'til after you've wed,\" said Ynaleigh. \"Being engaged is not enough.\"\n\"Might I see the dowry still?\" asked Welyn.\nKnowing how fabled the treasure was and understanding that this would likely be the closest the young man would come to possessing it, Ynaleigh agreed. He had grown quite found of Welyn. On his orders, Welyn, Ynaleigh, glum Genefra, and the castellan delved deep into the stronghold of Gunal. The first vault had to be opened by touching a series of runic symbols: should one of the marks be mispressed, a volley of poisoned arrows would have struck the thief. Ynaleigh was particularly proud of the next level of security -- a lock composed of blades with eighteen tumblers required three keys to be turned simultaneously to allow entry. The blades were designed to eviscerate any who merely picked one of the locks. Finally, they reached the storeroom.\nIt was entirely empty.\n\"By Lorkhan, we've been burgled!\" cried Ynaleigh. \"But how? Who could have done this?\"\n\"A humble but, if I may say so, rather talented burglar,\" said Welyn. \"A man who has loved your daughter from afar for many years, but did not possess the glamour or the learning to impress. That is, until the gold from her dowry afforded me the opportunity.\"\n\"You?\" bellowed Ynaleigh, scarcely able to believe it. Then something even more unbelievable happened.\nGenefra began to laugh. She had never even dreamed of meeting anyone like this thief. She threw herself into his arms before her father's outraged eyes. After a moment, Ynaleigh too began to laugh.\nGenefra and Welyn were married in a month's time. Though he was in fact quite poor and had little scholarship, Ynaleigh was amazed how much his wealth increased with such a son-in-law and business partner. He only made certain never to ask from whence came the excess gold.\nPublisher's Note:\nThe tale of a man trying to win the hand of a maiden whose father (usually a wealthy man or a king) tests each suitor is quite common. See, for instance, the more recent \"Four Suitors of Benitah\" by Jole Yolivess. The behavior of the characters is quite out of character for the Dwemer. No one today knows their marriage customs, or even if they had marriage at all.\nOne rather odd theory of the Disappearance of the Dwarves came from this and a few other tales of \"Marobar Sul.\" It was proposed that the Dwemer never, in fact, left. They did not depart Nirn, much less the continent of Tamriel, and they are still among us, disguised. These scholars use the story of \"Azura and the Box\" to suggest that the Dwemer feared Azura, a being they could neither understand nor control, and they adopted the dress and manner of Chimer and Altmer in order to hide from Azura's gaze.\n\nAncient Tales of the Dwemer, Part XI: Azura and the Box\nAzura and the Box\n\tAncient Tales\n\tof the Dwemer\n\tPart XI\nby\n\tMarobar Sul\nNchylbar had enjoyed an adventurous youth, but had grown to be a very wise, very old Dwemer who spent his life searching for the truth and dispelling superstitions. He invented much and created many theorems and logic structures that bore his name. But much of the world still puzzled him, and nothing was a greater enigma to him that the nature of the Aedra and Daedra. Over the course of his research, he came to the conclusion that many of the Gods were entirely fabricated by man and mer.\nNothing, however, was a greater question to Nchylbar than the limits of divine power. Were the Greater Beings the masters of the entire world, or did the humbler creatures have the strength to forge their own destinies? As Nchylbar found himself nearing the end of his life, he felt he must understand this last basic truth.\nAmong the sage's acquaintances was a holy Chimer priest named Athynic. When the priest was visiting Bthalag-Zturamz, Nchylbar told him what he intended to do to find the nature of divine power. Athynic was terrified and pleaded with his friend not to break this great mystery, but Nchylbar was resolute. Finally, the priest agreed to assist out of love for his friend, though he feared the results of this blasphemy.\nAthynic summoned Azura. After the usual rituals by which the priest declared his faith in her powers and Azura agreed to do no harm to him, Nchylbar and a dozen of his students entered the summoning chamber, carrying with them a large box.\n\"As we see you in our land, Azura, you are the Goddess of the Dusk and Dawn and all the mysteries therein,\" said Nchylbar, trying to appear as kindly and obsequious as he could be. \"It is said that your knowledge is absolute.\"\n\"So it is,\" smiled the Daedra.\n\"You would know, for example, what is in this wooden box,\" said Nchylbar.\nAzura turned to Athynic, her brow furrowed. The priest was quick to explain, \"Goddess, this Dwemer is a very wise and respected man. Believe me, please, the intention is not to mock your greatness, but to demonstrate it to this scientist and to the rest of his skeptical race. I have tried to explain your power to him, but his philosophy is such that he must see it demonstrated.\"\n\"If I am to demonstrate my might in a way to bring the Dwemer race to understanding, it might have been a more impressive feat you would have me do,\" growled Azura, and turned to look Nchylbar in the eyes. \"There is a red-petalled flower in the box.\"\nNchylbar did not smile or frown. He simply opened the box and revealed to all that it was empty.\nWhen the students turned to look to Azura, she was gone. Only Athynic had seen the Goddess's expression before she vanished, and he could not speak, he was trembling so. A curse had fallen, he knew that truly, but even crueler was the knowledge of divine power that had been demonstrated. Nchylbar also looked pale, uncertain on his feet, but his face shone with not fear, but bliss. The smile of a Dwemer finding evidence for a truth only suspected.\nTwo of his students supported him, and two more supported the priest as they left the chamber.\n\"I have studied very much over the years, performed countless experiments, taught myself a thousand languages, and yet the skill that has taught me the finally truth is the one that I learned when I was but a poor, young man, trying only to have enough gold to eat,\" whispered the sage.\nAs he was escorted up the stairs to his bed, a red flower petal fell from the sleeve of his voluminous robe. Nchylbar died that night, a portrait of peace that comes from contented knowledge.\nPublisher's Note:\nThis is another tale whose origin is unmistakably Dwemer. Again, the words of some Aldmeris translations are quite different, but the essence of the story is the same. The Dunmer have a similar tale about Nchylbar, but in the Dunmer version, Azura recognizes the trick and refuses to answer the question. She slays the Dwemer present for their skepticism and curses the Dunmer for blasphemy.\nIn the Aldmeris versions, Azura is tricked not by an empty box, but by a box containing a sphere which somehow becomes a flat square. Of course the Aldmeris versions, being a few steps closer to the original Dwemer, are much more difficult to understand. Perhaps this \"stage magic\" explanation was added by Gor Felim because of Felim's own experience with such tricks in his plays when a mage was not available.\n\"Marobar Sul\" left even the character of Nchylbar alone, and he represents many \"Dwemer\" virtues. His skepticism, while not nearly as absolute as in the Aldmeris version, is celebrated even though it brings a curse upon the Dwemer and the unnamed House of the poor priest.\nWhatever the true nature of the Gods, and how right or wrong the Dwemer were about them, this tale might explain why the dwarves vanished from the face of Tamriel. Though Nchylbar and his kind may not have intended to mock the Aedra and Daedra, their skepticism certainly offended the Divine Orders."

The earlier liability for slaves and animals was mainly confined to surrender, which, as in Sumerset Isles, later became compensation.\nAnd what does this matter for a study of our laws today? So far as concerns the influence of the Altmeri law upon our own, especially the Altmeri law of master and servant, the evidence of it is to be found in every judgment which has been recorded for the last five hundred years. It has been stated already that we still repeat the reasoning of the Altmeri magistrates, empty as it is, to the present day. And I will quickly show how Altmeri custom can be followed into the courts of the Dwemer.\nIn the laws of Karndar Watch (P.D. 1180) it is said, \"If one who is owned by another slays one who owns himself, the owner must pay the associates three fine instruments and the body of the one who his owned.\" There are many other similar citations. And the same principle is extended even to the case of a centurion by which a man is killed. \"If, at the common workbench, one is slain by an Animunculi, the associates of the slain may disassemble the Animunculi and take its parts within thirty days.\"\nIt is instructive to compare what Dhark has mentioned concerning the rude beasts of the Tenmar forests. \"If a marsh cat was killed by an Argonian, his family were in disgrace till they retaliated by killing the Argonian, or another like it; but further, if a marsh cat was killed by a fall from a tree, his relatives would take their revenge by toppling the tree, and shattering its branches, and casting them to every part of the forest.\""

    "text": "Argonian Account, Book 1\nThe Argonian Account\nBook One\nby \nWaughin Jarth\n\nOn a minor but respectable plaza in the Imperial City sat, or perhaps lounged, Lord Vanech's Building Commission. It was an unimaginative, austere building not noted so much for its aesthetic or architectural design as for its prodigious length. If any critics wondered why such an unornamented, extended erection held such fascination for Lord Vanech, they kept it to themselves.\nIn the 398th year of the 3rd Era, Decumus Scotti was a senior clerk at the Commission.\nIt had been a few months since the shy, middle-aged man had brought Lord Vanech the most lucrative of all contracts, granting the Commission the exclusive right to rebuild the roads of Valenwood which had been destroyed in the Five Year War. For this, he had become the darling of the managers and the clerks, spending his days recounting his adventures, more or less faithfully... although he did omit the ending of the tale, since many of them had partaken in the celebratory Unthrappa roast provided by the Silenstri. Informing one's listeners that they've gorged on human flesh improves very few stories of any good taste.\nScotti was neither particularly ambitious nor hard-working, so he did not mind that Lord Vanech had not given him anything to actually do.\nWhenever the squat little gnomish man would happen upon Decumus Scotti in the offices, Lord Vanech would always say, \"You're a credit to the Commission. Keep up the good work.\"\nIn the beginning, Scotti had worried that he was supposed to be doing something, but as the months went on, he merely replied, \"Thank you. I will.\"\nThere was, on the other hand, the future to consider. He was not a young man, and though he was receiving a respectable salary for someone not doing actual work, Scotti considered that soon he might have to retire and not get paid for not doing work. It would be nice, he decided, if Lord Vanech, out of gratitude for the millions of gold the Valenwood contract was generating, might deign to make Scotti a partner. Or at least give him a small percentage of the bounty.\nDecumus Scotti was no good at asking for things like that, which was one of the reasons why, previous to his signal successes in Valenwood as a senior clerk for Lord Atrius, he was a lousy agent. He had just about made up his mind to say something to Lord Vanech, when his lordship unexpectedly pushed things along.\n\"You're a credit to the Commission,\" the waddling little thing said, and then paused. \"Do you have a moment free on your schedule?\"\nScotti nodded eagerly, and followed his lordship to his hideously decorated and very enviable hectare of office space.\n\"Zenithar blesses us for your presence at the Commission,\" the little fellow squeaked grandly. \"I don't know whether you know this, but we were having a bad time before you came along. We had impressive projects, for certain, but they were not successful. In Black Marsh, for example, for years we've been trying to improve the roads and other routes of travel for commerce. I put my best man, Flesus Tijjo, on it, but every year, despite staggering investments of time and money, the trade along those routes only gets slower and slower. Now, we have your very clean, very, very profitable Valenwood contract to boost the Commission's profits. I think it's time you were rewarded.\"\nScotti grinned a grin of great modesty and subtle avarice.\n\"I want you to take over the Black Marsh account from Flesus Tijjo.\"\nScotti shook as if awaking from a pleasant dream to hideous reality, \"My Lord, I - I couldn't -\"\n\"Nonsense,\" chirped Lord Vanech. \"Don't worry about Tijjo. He will be happy to retire on the money I give him, particularly as soul-wrenchingly difficult as this Black Marsh business has been. Just your sort of a challenge, my dear Decumus.\"\nScotti couldn't utter a sound, though his mouth feebly formed the word \"No\" as Lord Vanech brought out the box of documentation on Black Marsh.\n\"You're a fast reader,\" Lord Vanech guessed. \"You can read it all en route.\"\n\"En route to ...\"\n\"Black Marsh, of course,\" the tiny fellow giggled. \"You are a funny chap. Where else would you go to learn about the work that's being done, and how to improve it?\"\nThe next morning, the stack of documentation hardly touched, Decumus Scotti began the journey south-east to Black Marsh. Lord Vanech had hired an able-bodied guard, a rather taciturn Redguard named Mailic, to protect his best agent. They rode south along the Niben, and then south-east along the Silverfish, continuing on into the wilds of Cyrodiil, where the river tributaries had no names and the very vegetation seemed to come from another world than the nice, civilized gardens of the northern Imperial Province.\nScotti's horse was tied to Mailic's, so the clerk was able to read. It made it difficult to pay attention to the path they were taking, but Scotti knew he needed at least a cursory familiarity with the Commission's business dealings in Black Marsh.\nIt was a huge box of paperwork going back forty years, when the Commission had first been given several million in gold by a wealthy trader, Lord Xellicles Pinos-Revina, to improve the condition of the road from Gideon to Cyrodiil. At that time, it took three weeks, a preposterously long time, for the rice and root he was importing to arrive, half-rotten, in the Imperial Province. Pinos-Revina was long dead, but many other investors over the decades, including Pelagius IV himself, had hired the Commission to build roads, drain swamps, construct bridges, devise anti-smuggling systems, hire mercenaries, and, in short, do everything that the greatest Empire in history knew would work to aid trade with Black Marsh. According to the latest figures, the result of this was that it took two and a half months for goods, now thoroughly rotten, to arrive.\nScotti found that when he looked up after concentrating on what he was reading, the landscape had always changed. Always dramatically. Always for the worse.\n\"This is Blackwood, sir,\" said Mailic to Scotti's unspoken question. It was dark and woodsy, so Decumus Scotti thought that a very appropriate name.\nThe question he longed to ask, which in due course he did ask, was, \"What's that terrible smell?\"\n\"Slough Point, sir,\" Mailic replied as they turned the next bend, where the umbrageous tunnel of tangled tree and vine opened to a clearing. There squatted a cluster of formal buildings in the dreary Imperial design favored by Lord Vanech's Commission and every Emperor since Tiber, together with a stench so eye-blindingly, stomach-wrenchingly awful that Scotti wondered, suddenly, if it were deadly poisonous. The swarms of blood-colored, sand-grain-sized insects obscuring the air did not improve the view.\nScotti and Mailic batted at the buzzing clouds as they rode their horses towards the largest of the buildings, which on approach revealed itself to be perched at the edge of a thick, black river. From its size and serious aspect, Scotti guessed it to be the census and excise office for the wide, white bridge that stretched across the burbling dark water to the reeds on the other side.  It was a very nice, bright, sturdy-looking bridge, built, Scotti knew, by his Commission.\nA poxy, irritable official opened the door quickly on Scotti's first knock. \"Come in, come in, quickly! Don't let the fleshflies in!\"\n\"Fleshflies?\" Decumus Scotti trembled. \"You mean, they eat human flesh?\"\n\"If you're fool enough to stand around and let them,\" the soldier said, rolling his eyes. He had half an ear, and Scotti, looking around at the other soldiers in the fort noted that they all were well-chewed. One of them had no nose at all to speak of. \"Now, what's your business?\"\nScotti told them, and added that if they stood outside the fortress instead of inside, they might catch more smugglers.\n\"You better be more concerned with getting across that bridge,\" the soldier sneered. \"Tide's coming up, and if you don't get a move on, you won't get to Black Marsh for four days.\"\nThat was absurd. A bridge swamped by a rising tide on a river? Only the look in the soldier's eyes told Scotti he wasn't joking.\nUpon stepping out of the fort, he saw that the horses, evidently tired of being tortured by the fleshflies, had ripped free of their restraints and were bounding off into the woods. The oily water of the river was already lapping on the planks, oozing between the crevices. Scotti reflected that perhaps he would be more than willing to endure a wait of four days before going to Black Marsh, but Mailic was already running across.\nScotti followed him, wheezing. He was not in excellent shape, and never had been. The box of Commission materials was heavy. Halfway across, he paused to catch his breath, and then discovered he could not move. His feet were stuck.\nThe black mud that ran through the river was a thick gluey paste, and having washed over the plank Scotti was on, it held his feet fast. Panic seized him. Scotti looked up from his trap and saw Mailic leaping from plank to plank ahead of him, closing fast on the reeds on the other side.\n\"Help!\" Scotti cried. \"I'm stuck!\"\nMailic did not even turn around, but kept jumping. \"I know, sir. You need to lose weight.\"\nDecumus Scotti knew he was a few pounds over, and had meant to start eating less and exercising more, but embarking on a diet hardly seemed to promise timely aid in his current predicament. No diet on Nirn would have helped him just then. However, on reflection, Scotti realized that the Redguard intended that he drop the box of documents, for Mailic was no longer carrying any of the essential supplies he had had with him previously.\nWith a sigh, Scotti threw the box of Commission notes into the glop, and felt the plank under him rise a quarter of an inch, just enough to free him from the mud's clutches. With an agility born of extreme fear, Scotti began leaping after Mailic, dropping onto every third plank, and springing up before the river gripped him.\nIn forty-six leaps, Decumus Scotti crashed through the reeds onto the solid ground behind Mailic, and found himself in Black Marsh. He could hear behind him a slurping sound as the bridge, and his container of important and official records of Commission affairs, was consumed by the rising flood of dark filth, never to be seen again.\nArgonian Account, Book 2\nThe Argonian Account\n\nBook Two\nBy\nWaughin Jarth\nDecumus Scotti emerged from the dirt and reeds, exhausted from running, his face and arms sheathed in red fleshflies.  Looking back towards Cyrodiil, he saw the bridge disappear beneath the thick black river, and he knew he was not getting back until the tide went down in a few days' time. The river also held in its adhesive depths his files on the Black Marsh account. He would have to rely on his memory for his contacts in Gideon.\nMailic was purposefully striding through the reeds ahead. Flailing ineffectually at the fleshflies, Scotti hurried after him.\n\"We're lucky, sir,\" said the Redguard, which struck Scotti as an extraordinarily odd thing to say, until his eyes followed where the man's finger was pointing. \"The caravan is here.\"\nTwenty-one rusted, mud-spattered wagons with rotting wood and wobbly wheels sat half-sunk in the soft earth ahead. A crowd of Argonians, gray-scaled and gray-eyed, the sort of sullen manual laborers that were common in Cyrodiil, pulled at one of the wagons which had been detached from the others. As Scotti and Mailic came closer, they saw it was filled with a cargo of black berries so decayed that they had become hardly recognizable... more a festering jelly than a wagonload of fruit.\nYes, they were going to the city of Gideon, and, yes, they said, Scotti could get a ride with them after they were finished unloading this shipment of lumberries.\n\"How long ago were they picked?\" Scotti asked, looking at the wagon's rotten produce.\n\"The harvest was in Last Seed, of course,\" said the Argonian who seemed to be in charge of the wagon. It was now Sun's Dusk, so they had been en route from the fields for a little over two months.\nClearly, Scotti thought, there were problems with transportation. But fixing that, after all, was what he was doing here as a representative of Lord Vanech's Building Commission.\nIt took close to an hour of the berries rotting even more in the sun for the wagon to be pushed to the side, the wagons in front of it and behind it to be attached to one another, and one of the eight horses from the front of the caravan to be brought around to the now independent wagon. The laborers moved with dispirited lethargy, and Scotti took the opportunity to inspect the rest of the caravan and talk to his fellow travellers.\nFour of the wagons had benches in them, fit for uncomfortable riders. All the rest were filled with grain, meat, and vegetation in various stages of corruption.\nThe travellers consisted of the six Argonian laborers, three Imperial merchants so bug-bitten that their skin looked as scaly as the Argonians themselves, and three cloaked fellows who were evidently Dunmer, judging by the red eyes that gleamed in the shadows under their hoods. All were transporting their goods along this, the Imperial Commerce Road.\n\"This is a road?\" Scotti exclaimed, looking at the endless field of reeds that reached up to his chin or higher.\n\"It's solid ground, of a sort,\" one of the hooded Dunmer shrugged. \"The horses eat some of the reed, and sometimes we set fire to it, but it just grows right back up.\"\nFinally, the wagonmaster signalled that the caravan was ready to go, and Scotti took a seat in the third wagon with the other Imperials. He looked around, but Mailic was not on board.\n\"I agreed to get to you to Black Marsh and take you back out,\" said the Redguard, who had plumped down a rock in the sea of reeds and was munching on a hairy carrot. \"I'll be here when you get back.\"\nScotti frowned, and not only because Mailic had dropped the deferential title \"sir\" while addressing him. Now he truly knew no one in Black Marsh, but the caravan slowly grinded and bumped forward, so there was no time to argue.\nA noxious wind blew across the Commerce Road, casting patterns in the endless featureless expanse of reeds. In the distance, there seemed to be mountains, but they constantly shifted, and Scotti realized they were banks of mist and fog. Shadows flitted across the landscape, and when Scotti looked up, he saw they were being cast by giant birds with long, saw-like beaks nearly the size of the rest of their bodies.\n\"Hackwings,\" Chaero Gemullus, an Imperial on Scotti's left, who might have been young but looked old and beaten, muttered. \"Like everything else in this damnable place, they'll eat you if you don't keep moving. Beggars pounce down and give you a nasty chop, and then fly off and come back when you're mostly dead from blood loss.\"\nScotti shivered. He hoped they'd be in Gideon before nightfall. It was then it occurred to him that the sun was on the wrong side of the caravan.\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" Scotti called to the wagonmaster. \"I thought you said we were going to Gideon?\"\nThe wagonmaster nodded.\n\"Why are we going north then, when we should be going south?\"\nThere was no reply but a sigh.\nScotti confirmed with his fellow travellers that they too were going to Gideon, and none of them seemed very concerned about the circuitous route to getting there. The seats were hard on his middle-aged back and buttocks, but the bumping rhythm of the caravan, and the hypnotic waving reeds gradually had an effect on him, and Scotti drifted off to sleep.\nHe awoke in the dark some hours later, not sure where he was. The caravan was no longer moving, and he was on the floor, under the bench, next to some small boxes. There were voices, speaking a hissing, clicking language Scotti didn't understand, and he peeked out between someone's legs to see what was happening.\nThe moons barely pierced the thick mist surrounding the caravan, and Scotti did not have the best angle to see who was talking. For a moment, it looked like the gray wagonmaster was talking to himself, but the darkness had movement and moisture, in fact, glistening scales. It was hard to tell how many of these things there were, but they were big, black, and the more Scotti looked at them, the more details he could see.\nWhen one particular detail emerged, huge mouths filled with dripping needle-like fangs, Scotti slipped back under the bench. Their black little eyes had not fallen on him yet.\nThe legs in front of Scotti moved and then began to thrash, as their owner was grabbed and pulled out of the wagon. Scotti crouched further back, getting behind the little boxes. He didn't know much about concealment, but had some experience with shields. He knew that having something, anything, in between you and bad things was always good.\nA few seconds after the legs had disappeared from sight, there was a horrible scream. And then a second and a third. Different timbres, different accents, but the same inarticulate message... terror, and pain, horrible pain. Scotti remembered a long forgotten prayer to the god Stendarr and whispered it to himself.\nThen there was silence... ghastly silence that lasted only a few minutes, but which seemed like hours... years.\nAnd then the carriage started rolling forward again.\nScotti cautiously crawled out from under the carriage. Chaero Gemullus gave him a bemused grin.\n\"There you are,\" he said. \"I thought the Nagas took you.\"\n\"Nagas?\"\n\"Nasty characters,\" Gemullus said, frowning. \"Puff adders with legs and arms, seven feet tall, eight when they're mad. Come from the inner swamp, and they don't like it here much so they're particularly peevish. You're the kind of posh Imperial they're looking for.\"\nScotti had never in his life thought of himself as posh. His mud and fleshfly-bespeckled clothing seemed eminently middle-class, at best, to him. \"What would they want me for?\"\n\"To rob, of course,\" the Imperial smiled. \"And to kill. You didn't notice what happened to the others?\" The Imperial frowned, as if struck by a thought. \"You didn't sample from those boxes down below, did you? Like the sugar, do you?\"\n\"Gods, no,\" Scotti grimaced.\nThe Imperial nodded, relieved. \"You just seem a little slow. First time to Black Marsh, I gather? Oh! Heigh ho, Hist piss!\"\nScotti was just about to ask Gemullus what that vulgar term meant when the rain began. It was an inferno of foul-smelling, yellow-brown rain that washed over the caravan, accompanied by the growl of thunder in the distance. Gemullus worked to pull the roof up over the wagon, glaring at Scotti until he helped with the laborious process.\nHe shuddered, not only from the cold damp, but from contemplation of the disgusting precipitation pouring down on the already nasty produce in the uncovered wagon.\n\"We'll be dry soon enough,\" Gemullus smiled, pointing out into the fog.\nScotti had never been to Gideon, but he knew what to expect. A large settlement more or less laid out like a Imperial city, with more or less Imperial style architecture, and all the Imperial comforts and traditions, more or less.\nThe jumble of huts half-sunk in mud was decidedly less.\n\"Where are we?\" asked Scotti, bewildered.\n\"Hixinoag,\" replied Gemullus, pronouncing the queer name with confidence. \"You were right. We were going north when we should have been going south.\"\nArgonian Account, Book 3\nThe Argonian Account\nBook Three\nby \nWaughin Jarth\nDecumus Scotti was supposed to be in Gideon, a thoroughly Imperialized city in southern Black Marsh, arranging business dealings to improve commerce in the province on behalf of Lord Vanech's Building Commission and its clients. Instead, he was in a half-submerged, rotten little village called Hixinoag, where he knew no one. Except for a drug smuggler named Chaero Gemullus.\nGemullus was not at all perturbed that the merchant caravan had gone north instead of south. He even let Scotti share his bucket of trodh, tiny little crunchy fish, he had bought from the villagers. Scotti would have preferred them cooked, or at any rate, dead, but Gemullus blithely explained that dead, cooked trodh are deadly poison.\n\"If I were where I was supposed to be,\" Scotti pouted, putting one of the wriggling little creatures in his mouth. \"I could be having a roast, and some cheese, and a glass of wine.\"\n\"I sell moon sugar in the north, and buy it in the south,\" he shrugged. \"You have to be more flexible, my friend.\"\n\"My only business is in Gideon,\" Scotti frowned.\n\"Well, you have a couple choices,\" replied the smuggler. \"You could just stay here. Most villages in Argonia don't stay put for very long, and there's a good chance Hixinoag will drift right down to the gates of Gideon. Might take you a month or two. Probably the easiest way.\"\n\"That'd put me far behind schedule.\"\n\"Next option, you could join up with the caravan again,\" said Gemullus. \"They might be going in the right direction this time, and they might not get stuck in the mud, and they might not be all murdered by Naga highwaymen.\"\n\"Not tempting,\" Scotti frowned. \"Any other ideas?\"\n\"Ride the roots. The underground express,\" Gemullus grinned. \"Follow me.\"\nScotti followed Gemullus out of the village and into a copse of trees shrouded by veils of wispy moss. The smuggler kept his eye on the ground, poking at the viscuous mud intermittently. Finally he found a spot which triggered a mass of big oily bubbles to rise to the surface.\n\"Perfect,\" he said. \"Now, the important thing is not to panic. The express will take you due south, that's the wintertide migration, and you'll know you're near Gideon when you see a lot of red clay. Just don't panic, and when you see a mass of bubbles, that's a breathing hole you can use to get out.\"\nScotti looked at Gemullus blankly. The man was talking perfect gibberish. \"What?\"\nGemullus took Scotti by the shoulder and positioning him on top of the mass of bubbles. \"You stand right here...\"\nScotti sank quickly into the mud, staring at the smuggler, horror-struck.\n\"And remember to wait 'til you see the red clay, and then the next time you see bubbles, push up...\"\nThe more Scotti wriggled to get free, the faster he sunk. The mud enveloped Scotti to his neck, and he continued staring, unable to articulate anything but a noise like \"Oog.\"\n\"And don't panic at the idea that you're being digested. You could live in a rootworm's belly for months.\"\nScotti took one last panicked gasp of air and closed his eyes before he disappeared into the mud.\nThe clerk felt a warmth he hadn't expected all around him. When he opened his eyes, he found that he was entirely surrounded by a translucent goo, and was traveling rapidly forward, southward, gliding through the mud as if it were air, skipping along an intricate network of roots. Scotti felt confusion and euphoria in equal measures, madly rushing forward through an alien environment of darkness, spinning around and over the thick fibrous tentacles of the trees. It was if he were high in the sky at midnight, not deep beneath the swamp in the Underground Express.\nLooking up slightly at the massive root structure above, Scotti saw something wriggle past. A eight-foot-long, armless, legless, colorless, boneless, eyeless, nearly shapeless creature, riding the roots. Something dark was inside of it, and as it came closer, Scotti could see it was an Argonian man. He waved, and the disgusting creature the Argonian was in flattened slightly and rushed onward.\nGemullus's words began to reappear in Scotti's mind at this sight. \"The wintertide migration,\" \"air hole,\" \"you're being digested,\" -- these were the phrases that danced around as if trying to find some place to live in a brain which was highly resistant to them coming in. But there was no other way to look at the situation. Scotti had gone from eating living fish to being eaten alive as a way of transport. He was in one of those worms.\nScotti made an executive decision to faint.\nHe awoke in stages, having a beautiful dream of being held in a woman's warm embrace. Smiling and opening his eyes, the reality of where he really was rushed over him.\nThe creature was still rushing madly, blindly forward, gliding over roots, but it was no longer like a flight through the night sky. Now it was like the sky at sunrise, in pinks and reds. Scotti remembered Gemullus telling him to look for the red clay, and he would be near Gideon. The next thing he had to find was the bubbles.\nThere were no bubbles anywhere. Though the inside of the worm was still warm and comfortable, Scotti felt the weight of the earth all around him. \"Just don't panic\" Gemullus had said, but it was one thing to hear that advice, and quite another to take it. He began to squirm, and the creature began to move faster at the increased pressure from within.\nSuddenly, Scotti saw it ahead of him, a slim spire of bubbles rising up through the mud from some underground stream, straight up, through the roots to the surface above him. The moment the rootworm went through it, Scotti pushed with all of his might upward, bursting through the creature's thin skin. The bubbles pushed Scotti up quickly, and before he could blink, he was popping out of the red slushy mud.\nTwo gray Argonians were standing under a tree nearby, holding a net. They looked in Scotti's direction with polite curiosity. In their net, Scotti noticed, were several squirming furry rat-like creatures. While he addressed them, another fell out of the tree. Though Scotti had not been educated in this practice, he recognized fishing when he saw it.\n\"Excuse me, lads,\" Scotti said jovially. \"I was wondering if you'd point me in the direction of Gideon?\"\nThe Argonians introduced themselves as Drawing-Flame and Furl-Of-Fresh-Leaves, and looked at one another, puzzling over the question.\n\"Who you seek?\" asked Furl-of-Fresh-Leaves.\n\"I believe his name is,\" said Scotti, trying to remember the contents of his long gone file of Black Marsh contacts in Gideon. \"Archein Right-Foot ...Rock?\"\nDrawing-Flame nodded, \"For five gold, show you way. Just east. Is plantation east of Gideon. Very nice.\"\nScotti thought that the best business he had heard of in two days, and handed Drawing-Flames the five septims.\nThe Argonians led Scotti onto a muddy ribbon of road that passed through the reeds, and soon revealed the bright blue expanse of Topal Bay far to the west. Scotti looked around at the magnificent walled estates, where bright crimson blossoms sprang forth from the very dirt of the walls, and surprised himself by thinking, \"This is very pretty.\"\nThe road ran parallel to a fast-moving stream, running eastward from Topal Bay. It was called the Onkobra River, he was told. It ran deep into Black Marsh, to the very dark heart of the province.\nPeeking past the gates to the plantations east of Gideon, Scotti saw that few of the fields were tended. Most had rotten crops from harvests past still clinging to wilted vines, orchards of desolate, leafless trees. The Argonian serfs who worked the fields were thin, weak, near death, more like haunting spirits than creatures of life and reason.\nTwo hours later, as the three continued their trudge east, the estates were still impressive at least from a distance, the road was still solid if weedy, but Scotti was irritated, horrified by the field workers and the agricultural state, and no longer charitable towards the area. \"How much further?\"\nFurl-of-Fresh-Leaves and Drawing-Flame looked at one another, as if that question was something that hadn't occurred to them.\n\"Archein is east?\" Furl-of-Fresh-Leaves pondered. \"Near or far?\"\nDrawing-Flame shrugged noncommittally, and said to Scotti, \"For five gold, show you way. Just east. Is plantation. Very nice.\"\n\"You don't have any idea, do you?\" Scotti cried. \"Why couldn't you tell me that in the first place when I might have asked someone else?\"\nAround the bend up ahead, there was the sound of hoofbeats. A horse coming closer.\nScotti began to walk towards the sound to hail the rider, and didn't see Drawing-Flame's taloned claws flash out and cast the spell at him. He felt it though. A kiss of ice along his spine, the muscles along his arms and legs suddenly immobile as if wrapped in rigid steel. He was paralyzed.\nThe great curse of paralysis, as the reader may be unfortunate enough to know, is that you continue to see and think even though your body does not respond. The thought that went through Scotti's mind was, \"Damn.\"\nFor Drawing-Flame and Furl-of-Fresh-Leaves were, of course, like most simple day laborers in Black Marsh, accomplished Illusionists. And no friend of the Imperial.\nThe Argonians shoved Decumus Scotti to the side of the road, just as the horse and rider came around the corner. He was an impressive figure, a nobleman in a flashing dark green cloak the exact same color as his scaled skin, and a frilled hood that was part of his flesh and sat upon his head like a horned crown.\n\"Greetings, brothers!\" the rider said to the two.\n\"Greetings, Archein Right-Foot-Rock,\" they responded, and then Furl-of-Fresh-Leaves added. \"What is milord's business on this fine day?\"\n\"No rest, no rest,\" the Archein sighed regally. \"One of my she-workers gave birth to twins. Twins! Fortunately, there's a good trader in town for those, and she didn't put up too much of a fuss. And then there's a fool of an Imperial from Lord Vanech's Building Commission I am supposed to meet with in Gideon. I'm sure he'll want the grand tour before he opens up the treasury for me. Such a lot of fuss.\"\nDrawing-Flame and Furl-of-Fresh-Leaves sympathesized, and then, as Archein Right-Foot-Rock rode off, they went to look for their hostage.\nUnfortunately for them, gravity being the same in Black Marsh as elsewhere in Tamriel, their hostage, Decumus Scotti, had continued to roll down from where they left him, and was, at that moment, in the Onkobra River, drowning.\nArgonian Account, Book 4\nThe Argonian Account\nBook Four\nBy\nWaughin Jarth\n\nDecumus Scotti was drowning, and he didn't think much of it. He couldn't move his arms or his legs to swim because of the paralysis spell the Argonian peasant had lobbed at him, but he wasn't quite sinking. The Onkobra River was a crashing force of white water and currents that could carry along large rocks with ease, so Scotti tumbled head over heels, spinning, bumping, bouncing along.\nHe figured that soon enough he would be dead, and that would be better than being in Black Marsh. He wasn't too panicked about it all when he felt his lungs fill with water and cold blackness fell upon him.\nFor a while, for the first time in some time, Decumus Scotti felt peace. Blessed darkness. And then pain came to him, and he felt himself coughing, spewing water up from his belly and his lungs.\nA voice said, \"Oh bother, he's alive, ain't he, now?\"\nScotti wasn't quite sure if that were true, even when he opened his eyes and looked at the face above him. It was an Argonian, but unlike any he had seen anywhere. The face was thin and long like a thick lance; the scales were ruby-red, brilliant in the sunlight. It blinked at him, its eyelids opening and closing in vertical slits.\n\"I don't suppose we should eat you, should we now?\" the creature smiled, and Scotti could tell from its teeth that it was no idle suggestion.\n\"Thank you,\" said Scotti weakly. He craned his head slightly to find out who the \"we\" were, and discovered he was on the muddy bank of the still, sludgy river, surrounded by a group of Argonians with similarly needle-like faces and a whole rainbow of scales. Bright greens and gem-like purples, blues, and oranges.\n\"Can you tell me, am I near - well, anywhere?\"\nThe ruby-colored Argonian laughed. \"No. You're in the middle of everywhere, and near nowhere.\"\n\"Oh,\" said Scotti, who grasped the idea that space did not mean much in Black Marsh. \"And what are you?\"\n\"We are Agacephs,\" the ruby-colored Argonian replied. \"My name is Nomu.\"\nScotti introduced himself. \"I'm a senior clerk in Lord Vanech's Building Commission in the Imperial City. My job was to come here to try to fix the problems with commerce, but I've lost my agenda, haven't met with any of my contacts, the Archeins of Gideon...\"\n\"Pompous, assimiliated, slaver kleptocrats,\" a small lemon-colored Agaceph murmured with some feeling.\n\"...And now I just want to go home.\"\nNomu smiled, his long mouth arching up like a host happy to see an unwanted guest leave a party. \"Shehs will guide you.\"\nShehs, it seemed, was the bitter little yellow creature, and he was not at all pleased at the assignment. With surprising strength, he hoisted Scotti up, and for a moment, the clerk was reminded of Gemullus dropping him into the bubbling muck that led to the Underground Express. Instead, Shehs shoved Scotti toward a tiny little raft, razor-thin, that bobbed on the surface of the water.\n\"This is how you travel?\"\n\"We don't have the broken wagons and dying horses of our brothers on the outside,\" Shehs replied, rolling his tiny eyes. \"We don't know better.\"\nThe Argonian sat at the back of the craft and used his whip-like tail to propel and navigate the craft. They traveled quickly around swirling pools of slime that stank of centuries of putrefaction, past pinnacled mountains that seemed sturdy but suddenly fell apart at the slightest ripple in the still water, under bridges that might have once been metal but were now purely rust.\n\"Everything in Tamriel flows down to Black Marsh,\" Shehs said.\nAs they slid through the water, Shehs explained to Scotti that the Agacephs were one of the many Argonian tribes that lived in the interior of the province, near the Hist, finding little in the outside world worth seeing. He was fortunate to have been found by them. The Nagas, the toad-like Paatru, and the winged Sarpa would have killed him on the spot.\nThere were other creatures too to be avoided. Though there were few natural predators in inner Black Marsh, the scavengers that rooted in the garbage seldom shied away from a living meal. Hackwings circled overhead, like the ones Scotti had seen in the west.\nShehs fell silent and stopped the raft completely, waiting for something.\nScotti looked in the direction Shehs was watching, and saw nothing unusual in the filthy water. Then, he realized that the pool of green slime in front of them was actually moving, and fairly quickly, from one bank to the other. It deposited small bones behind it as it oozed up into the reeds, and disappeared.\n\"Voriplasm,\" Shehs explained, moving the boat forward again. \"Big word. It'll strip you to the bone by the second syllable.\"\nScotti, desirous to distract himself from the sights and smells that surrounded him, thought it a good time to compliment his pilot on his excellent vocabulary. It was particularly impressive, given how far from civilization they were. The Argonians in the east did, in fact, speak so well.\n\"They tried to erect a Temple of Mara near here, in Umpholo, twenty years ago,\" Shehs explained, and Scotti nodded, remembering reading about it in the files before they were lost. \"They all perished quite dreadfully of swamp rot in the first month, but they left behind some excellent books.\"\nScotti was going to inquire further when he saw something so huge, so horrifying, it made him stop, frozen.\nHalf submerged in the water ahead was a mountain of spines, lying on nine-foot-long claws. White eyes stared blindly forward, and then suddenly the whole creature spasmed and lurched, the jaw of its mouth jutting out, exposing tusks clotted with gore.\n\"Swamp Leviathan,\" Shehs whistled, impressed. \"Very, very dangerous.\"\nScotti gasped, wondering why the Agaceph was so calm, and more, why he was continuing to steer the raft forward towards the beast..\n\"Of all the creatures in the world, the rats are sometimes the worst,\" said Shehs, and Scotti noticed that the huge creature was only a husk. Its movement was from the hundreds of rats that had burrowed into it, rapidly eating their way from the inside out, bursting from the skin in spots.\n\"They are indeed,\" Scotti said, and his mind went to the Black Marsh files, buried deep in the mud, and four decades of Imperial work in Black Marsh.\nThe two continued westward through the heart of Black Marsh.\nShehs showed Scotti the vast complicated ruins of the Kothringi capitals, fields of ferns and flowered grasses, quiet streams under canopies of blue moss, and the most astonishing sight of Scotti's life -- the great forest of full-grown Hist trees. They never saw a living soul until they arrived at the edge of the Imperial Commerce Road just east of Slough Point, where Mailic, Scotti's Redguard guide, was waiting patiently.\n\"I was going to give you two more minutes,\" the Redguard scowled, dropping the last of his food onto the pile at his feet. \"No more, sir.\"\nThe sun was shining bright when Decumus Scotti rode into the Imperial City, and as it caught the morning dew, it lent a glisten to every building as if they had been newly polished for his arrival. It astonished him how clean the city was. And how few beggars there were.\nThe protracted edifice of Lord Vanech's Building Commission was the same as it had always been, but still the very sight of it seemed exotic and strange. It was not covered in mud. The people within actually, generally, worked.\nLord Vanech himself, though singularly squat and squinty, seemed immaculate, not only relatively clean of dirt and scabs, but also relatively uncorrupt. Scotti couldn't help but stare at him when he first caught sight of his boss. Vanech stared right back.\n\"You are a sight,\" the little fellow frowned. \"Did your horse drag you to Black Marsh and back? I would say go home and fix yourself, but there are a dozen people here to see you. I hope you have solutions for them.\"\nIt was no exaggeration. Nearly twenty of Cyrodiil's most powerful and wealthiest people were waiting for him. Scotti was given an office even larger than Lord Vanech's, and he met with each.\nFirst among the Commission's clients were five independent traders, blustering and loaded with gold, demanding to know what Scotti intended to do about improving the trade routes. Scotti summarized for them the conditions of the main roads, the state of the merchants' caravans, the sunken bridges, and all the other impediments between the frontier and the marketplace. They told him to have everything replaced and repaired, and gave him the gold necessary to do it.\nWithin three months, the bridge at Slough Point had disappeared into the muck; the great caravan had collapsed into decrepitude; and the main road from Gideon had been utterly swallowed up by swamp water. The Argonians began once again to use the old ways, their personal rafts and sometimes the Underground Express to transport the grain in small quantities. It took a third of the time, two weeks, to arrive in Cyrodiil, none of it rotten.\nThe Archbishop of Mara was the next client Scotti met with. A kindhearted man, horrified by the tales of Argonian mothers selling their children into slavery, he pointedly asked Scotti if it were true.\n\"Sadly, yes,\" Scotti replied, and the Archbishop showered him with septims, telling the clerk that food must be brought to the province to ease their suffering, and the schools must be improved so they could learn to help themselves.\nWithin five months, the last book had been stolen from the deserted Maran monastery in Umphollo. As the Archeins went bankrupt, their slaves returned to his parents' tiny farms. The backwater Argonians found that they could grow enough to feed their families provided they had enough hard workers in their enclave, and the buyers market for slaves sharply declined.\nAmbassador Tsleeixth, concerned about the rising crime in northern Black Marsh, brought with him the contributions of many other expatriate Argonians like himself. They wanted more Imperial guards on the border at Slough Point, more magically lit lanterns posted along the main roads at regular intervals, more patrol stations, and more schools built to allow young Argonians to better themselves and not turn to crime.\nWithin six months, there were no more Nagas roaming the roads, as there were no merchants traveling them to rob. The thugs returned to the fetid inner swamp, where they felt much happier, their constitutions enriched by the rot and pestilence that they loved. Tsleeixth and his constituency were so pleased by the crime rate dropping, they brought even more gold to Decumus Scotti, telling him to keep up the good work.\nBlack Marsh simply was, is, and always shall be unable to sustain a large-scale, cash-crop plantation economy. The Argonians, and anyone else, the whole of Tamriel, could live in Black Marsh on subsistence farming, just raising what they needed. That was not sad, Scotti thought; that was hopeful.\nScotti's solution to each of their dilemmas had been the same. Ten percent of the gold they gave him went to Lord Vanech's Building Commission. The rest Scotti kept for himself, and did exactly nothing about the requests.\nWithin a year, Decumus Scotti had embezzled enough to retire very comfortably, and Black Marsh was better off than it had been in forty years."

    "text": "Beggar Prince\nThe story of Wheedle\n\tand his gifts from the Daedric Lord Namira\n\nWe look down upon the beggars of the Empire. These lost souls are the poor and wretched of the land. Every city has its beggars. Most are so poor they have only the clothes on their backs. They eat the scraps the rest of us throw out. We toss them a coin so that we don't have to think too long about their plight.\nImagine my surprise when I heard the tale of the Beggar Prince. I could not imagine what a Prince of Beggars would be. Here is the tale I heard. It takes place in the first age, when gods walked like men and daedra stalking the wilderness with impunity. It is a time before they were all confined to Oblivion.\nThere once was a man named Wheedle. Or maybe it was a woman. The story goes to great lengths to avoid declaring Wheedle's gender. Wheedle was the 13th child of a king in Valenwood. As such Wheedle was in no position to take the throne or even inherit much property or wealth.\nWheedle had left the palace to find independent fortune and glory. After many days of endless forest roads and tiny villages, Wheedle came upon a three men surrounding a beggar. The beggar was swaddled in rags from head to toe. No portion of the vagabond's body was visible. The men were intent on slaying the beggar.\nWith a cry of rage and indignation, Wheedle charged the men with sword drawn. Being simple townsfolk, armed only with pitchforks and scythes, they immediately fled from the armored figure with the shining sword.\n\"Many thanks for saving me,\" wheezed the beggar from beneath the heap of foul rags. Wheedle could barely stand the stench.\n\"What is your name, wretch?\" Wheedle asked.\n\"I am Namira.\"\nUnlike the townsfolk, Wheedle was well learned. That name meant nothing to them, but to Wheedle it was an opportunity.\n\"You are the Daedric lord!\" Wheedle exclaimed. \"Why did you allow those men to harass you? You could have slain them all with a whisper.\"\n\"I am please you recognized me,\" Namira rasped. \"I am frequently reviled by townsfolk. It pleases me to be recognized for my attribute, if not for my name.\"\nWheedle knew that Namira was the Daedric lord of all thing gross and repulsive. Diseases such as leprosy and gangrene were her domain. Where others might have seen danger, Wheedle saw opportunity.\n\"Oh, great Namira, let me apprentice myself to you. I ask only that you grant me powers to make my fortune and forge a name for myself that will live through the ages.\"\n\"Nay. I make my way alone in the world. I have no need for an apprentice.\"\nNamira shambled off down the road. Wheedle would not be put off. With a bound, Wheedle was at Namira's heel, pressing the case for an apprenticeship. For 33 days and nights, Wheedle kept up the debate. Namira said nothing, but Wheedle's voice was ceaseless. Finally, on the 33rd day, Wheedle was too hoarse to talk.\nNamira looked back on the suddenly silent figure. Wheedle knelt in the mud at her feet, open hands raised in supplication.\n\"It would seem you have completed your apprenticeship to me after all,\" Namira declared. \"I shall grant your request.\"\nWheedle was overjoyed.\n\"I grant you the power of disease. You may choose to be afflicted with any disease you choose, changing them at will, so long as it has visible symptoms. However, you must always bear at least one.\n\"I grant you the power of pity. You may evoke pity in anyone that sees you.\n\"Finally, I grant you the power of disregard. You may cause others to disregard your presence.\"\nWheedle was aghast. These were not boons from which a fortune could be made. They were curses, each awful in its own right, but together they were unthinkable.\n\"How am I to make my fortune and forge a name for myself with these terrible gifts?\"\n\"As you begged at my feet for 33 days and 33 nights, so shall you now beg for your fortune in the cities of men. Your name will become legendary among the beggars of Tamriel. The story of Wheedle, the Prince of Beggars, shall be handed down throughout the generations.\nIt was as Namira predicted. Wheedle was an irresistible beggar. None could see the wretch without desperately wanting to toss a coin at the huddled form. However, Wheedle also discovered that the power of disregard gave great access to the secrets of the realms. People unknowingly said important things where Wheedle could hear them. Wheedle grew to know the comings and goings of every citizen in the city.\nTo this day, it is said that if you really want to know something, go ask the beggars. They have eyes and ears throughout the cities. They know all the little secrets of the daily lives of its citizens."

    "text": "Biography of Barenziah, v1\nBiography of Barenziah\nVolume One\nby \nStern Gamboge\nImperial Scribe\nLate in the Second Era, a girl-child, Barenziah, was born to the rulers of the kingdom of Mournhold in what is now the Imperial Province of Morrowind.  She was reared in all the luxury and security befitting a royal Dark Elven child until she reached five years of age.  At that time, His Excellency Tiber Septim I, the first Emperor of Tamriel, demanded that the decadent rulers of Morrowind yield to him and institute imperial reforms.  Trusting to their vaunted magic, the Dark Elves impudently refused until Tiber Septim's army was on the borders. An Armistice was hastily signed by the now-eager Dunmer, but not before there were several battles, one of which laid waste to Mournhold, now called Almalexia.\nLittle Princess Barenziah and her nurse were found among the wreckage.  The Imperial General Symmachus, himself a Dark Elf, suggested to Tiber Septim that the child might someday be valuable, and she was therefore placed with a loyal supporter who had recently retired from the Imperial Army.\nSven Advensen had been granted the title of Count upon his retirement; his fiefdom, Darkmoor, was a small town in central Skyrim.  Count Sven and his wife reared the princess as their own daughter, seeing to it that she was educated appropriately-and more importantly, that the imperial virtues of obedience, discretion, loyalty, and piety were instilled in the child.  In short, she was made fit to take her place as a member of the new ruling class of Morrowind.\nThe girl Barenziah grew in beauty, grace, and intelligence.  She was sweet-tempered, a joy to her adoptive parents and their five young sons, who loved her as their elder sister.  Other than her appearance, she differed from young girls of her class only in that she had a strong empathy for the woods and fields, and was wont to escape her household duties to wander there at times.\nBarenziah was happy and content until her sixteenth year, when a wicked orphan stable-boy, whom she had befriended out of pity, told her he had overheard a conspiracy between her guardian, Count Sven, and a Redguard visitor to sell her as a concubine in Rihad, as no Nord or Breton would marry her on account of her black skin, and no Dark Elf would have her because of her foreign upbringing.\n\"Whatever shall I do?\" the poor girl said, weeping and trembling, for she had been brought up in innocence and trust, and it never occurred to her that her friend the stable-boy would lie to her.\nThe wicked boy, who was called Straw, said that she must run away if she valued her virtue, but that he would come with her as her protector.  Sorrowfully, Barenziah agreed to this plan; and that very night, she disguised herself as a boy and the pair escaped to the nearby city of Whiterun.  After a few days there, they managed to get jobs as guards for a disreputable merchant caravan.  The caravan was heading east by side roads in a mendacious attempt to elude the lawful tolls charged on the imperial highways.  Thus the pair eluded pursuit until they reached the city of Rifton, where they ceased their travels for a time.  They felt safe in Rifton, close as it was to the Morrowind border so that Dark Elves were enough of a common sight.\n\nBiography of Barenziah, v2\nBiography of Barenziah\nVolume Two\nby \nStern Gamboge\nImperial Scribe\nThe first volume of this series told the story of Barenziah's origin-heiress to the throne of Mournhold until her father rebelled against His Excellency Tiber Septim I and brought ruin to the province of Morrowind.  Thanks largely to the benevolence of the Emperor, the child Barenziah was not destroyed with her parents, but reared by Count Sven of Darkmoor, a loyal Imperial trustee.  She grew up into a beautiful and pious child, trustful of her guardian's care.  This trust, however, was exploited by a wicked orphan stable boy at Count Sven's estate, who with lies and fabrications tricked her into fleeing Darkmoor with him when she turned sixteen.  After many adventures on the road, they settled in Riften, a Skyrim city near the Morrowind borders.\nThe stable boy, Straw, was not altogether evil.  He loved Barenziah in his own selfish fashion, and deception was the only way he could think of that would cement possession of her.  She, of course, felt only friendship toward him, but he was hopeful that she would gradually change her mind.  He wanted to buy a small farm and settle down into a comfortable marriage, but at the time his earnings were barely enough to feed and shelter them.\nAfter only a short time in Riften, Straw fell in with a bold, villainous Khajiit thief named Therris, who proposed that they rob the Imperial Commandant's house in the central part of the city.  Therris said that he had a client, a traitor to the Empire, who would pay well for any information they could gather there.  Barenziah happened to overhear this plan and was appalled.  She stole away from their rooms and walked the streets of Riften in desperation, torn between her loyalty to the Empire and her love for her friends.\nIn the end, loyalty to the Empire prevailed over personal friendship, and she approached the Commandant's house, revealed her true identity, and warned him of her friends' plan.  The Commandant listened to her tale, praised her courage, and assured her that no harm would come to her.  He was none other than General Symmachus, who had been scouring the countryside in search of her since her disappearance, and had just arrived in Riften, hot in pursuit.  He took her into his custody, and informed her that, far from being sent away to be sold, she was to be reinstated as the Queen of Mournhold as soon as she turned eighteen.  Until that time, she was to live with the Septim family in the newly built Imperial City, where she would learn something of government and be presented at the Imperial Court.\nAt the Imperial City, Barenziah befriended the Emperor Tiber Septim during the middle years of his reign.  Tiber's children, particularly his eldest son and heir Pelagius, came to love her as a sister.  The ballads of the day praised her beauty, chastity, wit, and learning.  On her eighteenth birthday, the entire Imperial City turned out to watch her farewell procession preliminary to her return to her native land.  Sorrowful as they were at her departure, all knew that she was ready for her glorious destiny as sovereign of the kingdom of Mournhold.\n\nBiography of Barenziah, v3\nBiography of Barenziah\nVolume Three\nby \nStern Gamboge\nImperial Scribe\nIn the second volume of this series, it was told how Barenziah was kindly welcomed to the newly constructed Imperial City by the Emperor Tiber Septim and his family, who treated her like a long-lost daughter during her almost one-year stay.  After several happy months there learning her duties as vassal queen under the Empire, the Imperial General Symmachus escorted her to Mournhold where she took up her duties as Queen of her people under his wise guidance.  Gradually they came to love one another and were married and crowned in a splendid ceremony at which the Emperor himself officiated.\nAfter several hundred years of marriage, a son, Helseth, was born to the royal couple amid celebration and joyous prayer.  Although it was not publicly known at the time, it was shortly before this blessed event that the Staff of Chaos had been stolen from its hiding place deep in the Mournhold mines by a clever, enigmatic bard known only as the Nightingale.\nEight years after Helseth's birth, Barenziah bore a daughter, Morgiah, named after Symmachus' mother, and the royal couple's joy seemed complete.  Alas, shortly after that, relations with the Empire mysteriously deteriorated, leading to much civil unrest in Mournhold.  After fruitless investigations and attempts at reconciliation, in despair Barenziah took her young children and travelled to the Imperial City herself to seek the ear of then Emperor Uriel Septim VII.  Symmachus remained in Mournhold to deal with the grumbling peasants and annoyed nobility, and do what he could to stave off an impending insurrection.\nDuring her audience with the Emperor, Barenziah, through her magical arts, came to realize to her horror and dismay that the so-called Emperor was an impostor, none other than the bard Nightingale who had stolen the Staff of Chaos.  Exercising great self-control she concealed this realization from him.  That evening, news came that Symmachus had fallen in battle with the revolting peasants of Mournhold, and that the kingdom had been taken over by the rebels.  Barenziah, at this point, did not know where to seek help, or from whom.\nThe gods, that fateful night, were evidently looking out for her as if in redress of her loss.  King Eadwyre of High Rock, an old friend of Uriel Septim and Symmachus, came by on a social call.  He comforted her, pledged his friendship-and furthermore, confirmed her suspicions that the Emperor was indeed a fraud, and none other than Jagar Tharn, the Imperial Battlemage, and one of the Nightingale's many alter egos.  Tharn had supposedly retired into seclusion from public work and installed his assistant, Ria Silmane, in his stead.  The hapless assistant was later put to death under mysterious circumstances-supposedly a plot implicating her had been uncovered, and she had been summarily executed.  However, her ghost had appeared to Eadwyre in a dream and revealed to him that the true Emperor had been kidnapped by Tharn and imprisoned in an alternate dimension.  Tharn had then used the Staff of Chaos to kill her when she attempted to warn the Elder Council of his nefarious plot.\nTogether, Eadwyre and Barenziah plotted to gain the false Emperor's confidence.  Meanwhile, another friend of Ria's, known only as the Champion, who apparently possessed great, albeit then untapped, potential, was incarcerated at the Imperial Dungeons.  However, she had access to his dreams, and she told him to bide his time until she could devise a plan that would effect his escape.  Then he could begin on his mission to unmask the impostor.\nBarenziah continued to charm, and eventually befriended, the ersatz Emperor.  By contriving to read his secret diary, she learned that he had broken the Staff of Chaos into eight pieces and hidden them in far-flung locations scattered across Tamriel.  She managed to obtain a copy of the key to Ria's friend's cell and bribed a guard to leave it there as if by accident.  Their Champion, whose name was unknown even to Barenziah and Eadwyre, made his escape through a shift gate Ria had opened in an obscure corner of the Imperial Dungeons using her already failing powers.  The Champion was free at last, and almost immediately went to work.\nIt took Barenziah several more months to learn the hiding places of all eight Staff pieces through snatches of overheard conversation and rare glances at Tharn's diary.  Once she had the vital information, however -- which she communicated to Ria forthwith, who in turn passed it on to the Champion-she and Eadwyre lost no time.  They fled to Wayrest, his ancestral kingdom in the province of High Rock, where they managed to fend off the sporadic efforts of Tharn's henchmen to haul them back to the Imperial City, or at the very least obtain revenge.  Tharn, whatever else might be said of him, was no one's fool-save perhaps Barenziah's -- and he concentrated most of his efforts toward tracking down and destroying the Champion.\nAs all now know, the courageous, indefatigable, and forever nameless Champion was successful in reuniting the eight sundered pieces of the Staff of Chaos.  With it, he destroyed Tharn and rescued the true Emperor, Uriel Septim VII.  Following what has come to be known as the Restoration, a grand state memorial service was held for Symmachus at the Imperial City, befitting the man who had served the Septim Dynasty for so long and so well.\nBarenziah and good King Eadwyre had come to care deeply for one another during their trials and adventures, and were married in the same year shortly after their flight from the Imperial City.  Her two children from her previous marriage with Symmachus remained with her, and a regent was appointed to rule Mournhold in her absence.\nUp to the present time, Queen Barenziah has been in Wayrest with Prince Helseth and Princess Morgiah.  She plans to return to Mournhold after Eadwyre's death.  Since he was already elderly when they wed, she knows that that event, alas, could not be far off as the Elves reckon time.  Until then, she shares in the government of the kingdom of Wayrest with her husband, and seems glad and content with her finally quiet, and happily unremarkable, life.\n"

    "text": "Bone, Part I\n\"It seems to me,\" said Garaz, thoughtfully looking into the depths of  his flin. \"That all great ideas come from pure happenstance. Take for  instance, the story I told you last night about my cousin. If he hadn't  fallen off that horse, he never would have become one of the Empire's  foremost alchemists.\"\nIt was late one Middas night at the King's Ham, and the regulars were  always especially inclined toward philosophy.\n\"I disagree,\" replied Xiomara, firmly but politely. \"Great ideas and  inventions are most often formed slowly over time by diligence and hard  work. If you'll recall my tale from last month, the young lady -- who I  assure you is based on a real person -- only recognized her one true  love after she had slept with practically everyone in Northpoint.\"\n\"I put it to you that neither is the case,\" said Hallgerd, pouring a  topper on his mug of greef. \"The greatest inventions are created by  extraordinary need. Must I remind you of the story I told some time ago  about Arslic Oan and the invention of bonemold?\"\n\"The problem with your theory is that your example is entirely  fictional,\" sniffed Xiomara.\n\"I don't believe I remember the story of Arslic Oan and the invention of  bonemold,\" frowned Garaz. \"Are you sure you told us?\"\n\"Well, this happened many, many, many years ago, when Vvardenfell was a  beauteous green land, when Dunmer were Chimer and Dwemer and Nord lived  together in relative peace when they weren't trying to kill one  another,\" Hallgerd relaxed in his chair, warming to his theme. \"When the  sun and moons all hung in the sky together--\"\n\"Lord, Mother, and Wizard!\" grumbled Xiomara. \"If I'm going to be forced  to hear your ridiculous story again, pray don't embellish and make it  any longer than it has to be.\"\nThis all happened in Vvardenfell quite some time ago (said Hallgerd,  ignoring Xiomara's interruption with admirable restraint) during an era  of a king you would never have heard of. Arslic Oan was one of this  king's nobles and very, very disagreeable fellow. Because of his  allegiance to the crown, the king had felt the need to grant him a  castle and land, but he didn't necessarily want him as a neighbor so the  land he granted was far from civilization. Right in an area of  Vvardenfell that is, even today, not quite civilized to this day. Arslic  Oan built a walled stronghold and settled down with his unhappy slaves  to enjoy a quiet if somewhat grim life.\nIt was not long before his stronghold's integrity was tested. A tribe of  cannibalistic Nords had been living in the valley for some time, mostly  dining on one another, but occasionally foraging what they liked to  call dark meat, the Dunmer.\nXiomara laughed with appreciation. \"Marvelous! I don't remember that  from before. It's funny how you don't hear much about the Nords' rampant  cannibalism nowadays.\"\nThis was obviously, as I've said, quite some time ago (said Hallgerd,  glaring at part of his audience with civil malevolence) and things were  in many ways quite different. These cannibalistic Nords began attacking  Arslic Oan's slaves in the fields, and then slowly grew bolder, until  they held the very stronghold itself under siege. They were quite a  fearsome sight you can imagine: a horde of wild-eyed men and women with  dagger-like teeth filed to tear flesh, wielding massive clubs, cloaked  only in the skins of their victims.\nArslic Oan assumed that if he ignored them, they'd go away.\nUnfortunately, the first thing that the Nords did was to poison the  stream that carried water into the walled stronghold. All the livestock  and most of the slaves died very quickly before this was discovered.  There was no hope of rescue, at least for several months when the king's  emissaries would come reluctantly to visit the disagreeable vassal. The  next closest source of water was on the other side of the hill, so  Arslic Oan sent three of his slaves with empty jugs to bring some back.\nThey were beaten with clubs and eaten before they were a few feet  outside the stronghold gates. The next group he sent through he gave  sticks to defend themselves. They made it a few feet farther, but were  also overwhelmed, beaten, and devoured. It was obvious that better  personal defensive was required. Arslic Oan went to talk to his armorer,  one of his few slaves with specific talents and duties.\n\"The slaves need armor if they're going to make it to the river and  back,\" he said. \"Collect every scrap of steel and iron you can find,  every hinge, knife, ring, cup, everything that isn't needed to keep the  walls sturdy, smelt it, and give me the most and the best armor you can,  very, very quickly.\"\nThe armorer, whose name was Gorkith, was used to Arslic Oan's demands,  and knew that there could be no compromise on the quality and quantity  of the armor, or the speed at which he worked. He labored for thirty  hours without a break - and, recall, without any water to slake his  thirst as he struggled with the kiln and anvil - until finally, he had  six suits of mixed-metal armor.\nSix slaves were chosen, clad in the armor, and sent with jars to collect  river water. At first, the mission progressed well. The Nord attacked  the armored slaves with their clubs, but they continued their march  forward, warding off the blows. Gradually, however, the slaves seemed to  be walking uncertainly, dazed by the endless barrage. Eventually, one  by one, they fell, the armor was peeled from their bodies, and they were  eaten.\n\"The slaves couldn't move quickly enough in that heavy armor you made,\"  said Arslic Oan to Gorkith. \"I need you to collect all the cadavers of  the poisoned livestock, strip their skin, and give me the most and the  best leather armor you can, very, very quickly.\"\nGorklith did as he was told, though it was a particularly repulsive task  given the rancid state of the livestock. Normally it takes quite a time  to treat and cure leather, so I understand, but Gorklith worked at it  tirelessly, and in a half a day he had twelve suits of leather armor.\nTwelve slaves were chosen, clad in the armor, and sent with jars to  collect river water. They progressed, at first, much better than the  earlier expedition. Two fell almost immediately, but the others had some  luck out-maneuvering their assailants while deflecting an occasional  blow of the club. Several got to the river, three were able to fill up  their jars, and one fellow very nearly made it back to the stronghold  gates. Alas, he fell and was eaten. The Nords possessed a remarkably  healthy appetite.\n\"What we need before I completely run out of slaves,\" said Arslic Oan  thoughtfully to Gorkith. \"Is an armor sturdier than leather but lighter  than metal.\"\nThe armorer had already considered that and taken stock of the materials  available. He had thought about doing something with stone or wood, but  there were practical problems with demolishing more of the stronghold.  The next most prevalent stuff present in the stronghold was skinned dead  bodies, hunks of muscle, fat, blood, and bone. For six hours, he toiled  relentlessly until he produced eighteen suits of bonemold, the first  ones ever created. Arslic Oan was somewhat dubious at the sight (and  smell) but he was very thirsty, and willing to sacrifice another  eighteen slaves if necessary.\n\"Might I suggest,\" Gorklith queried tremulously, \"Having the slaves  practice moving about in the armor, here in the courtyard, before  sending them to face the Nords?\"\nArslic Oan coolly allowed it, and for a few hours, the slaves wandered  about the stronghold courtyard in their suits of bonemold. They grew  used to the give of the joints, the rigidity of the backplate, the  weight pushed onto their shoulders and hips. They discovered how to  plant their feet slightly askew to keep their balance steady; how to  quickly turn, pivoting without falling down; how to break into a run and  stop quickly. By the time they were sent out of the castle gates, they  were easily very nearly almost amateurs in the use of their medium  weight armor.\nSeventeen of them were killed and eaten, but one made it back with a jar  of water.\n\"It's perfect nonsense,\" said Xiomara. \"But my point is still valid even  so. Like all great inventors, even in fiction, the armorer worked  diligently to create the bonemold.\"\n\"I think there was a good deal of happenstance as well,\" frowned Garaz.  \"But it is an appalling story. I wish you hadn't told me.\"\n\"If you think that's appalling,\" grinned Hallgerd. \"You should hear what  happened next.\"\nBone, Part II\n\"What do you mean the story gets more appalling?\" Garaz was incredulous.  \"How in Boethiah's name could it get more appalling?\"\n\"It's a ruse,\" Xiomara scoffed, ordering two more mugs of greef and a  glass of flin for Garaz. \"How much worse can a tale get which  prominently features cannibalism, abuse of slaves, and the regular  placement of rotting animal carcasses?\"\n\"Don't you dare dare me,\" growled Hallgerd, annoyed by his listeners'  lack of appreciation of his prose styling. \"Remind me where we were?\"\n\"Arslic Oan is the owner of a stronghold under siege by savage,  cannibalistic Nords,\" said Xiomara, keeping a straight face. \"After a  lot of deaths and several unsuccessful attempts to get water, he had his  armorer with the unlikely name of Gorkith outfit his slaves with the  first ever bonemold armor. One of them finally makes it back with some  water.\"\nIt was only one jarful of water (said Hallgerd, pulling back in his  chair and continuing the tale), and Arslic Oan drank most of it, passing  the remains to his dear armorer Gorkith and the last dribbles to the  few dozen slaves who still lived. It was hardly enough to sustain health  and well-being. Another expedition was necessary, but they had only one  suit of bonemold left, as there was only one survivor of the trip.\n\"One out of eighteen slaves made it through the gauntlet of Nords  wearing that marvelous bonemold armor of yours,\" said Arslic Oan to  Gorkith. \"And one can only carry back enough water for one. Therefore,  mathematically, as we have, counting you and me, fifty-six remaining  people at the stronghold, we need armor for fifty-four. Since we already  have one, you only need to make fifty-three to make the total. That  way, three will make it back, with enough water for you and me and  whoever's in the best condition to partake. I don't know what we'll do  after that, but if we wait, we won't have enough slaves to fetch even a  couple days' worth of water.\"\n\"I understand,\" whimpered Gorkith. \"But how am I going to make the  armor? I used all the livestock bones to make the first batch of  bonemold.\"\nArslic Oan gave an order which Gorkith fearfully complied with. In  eighteen hours -\n\"What do you mean 'Arslic Oan gave an order which Gorkith fearfully  complied with'?\" asked Xiomara. \"What was the order?\"\n\"All will be clear,\" smiled Hallgerd. \"I have to chose what to reveal  and what to conceal. Such is the way of the tale teller.\"\nIn eighteen hours, Gorkith had fifty-three suits of bonemail (said  Hallgerd, continuing, not really minding the interruption) prepared for  the slaves. Without prompting, he ordered the slaves to practice using  the armor, and even allowed them more training time than their  predecessors. They not only learned how to move and stop quickly in  bonemold, but how to adjust their peripheral vision to see a blow before  it came, and to sway to dodge, and where the sturdiest reinforcement  points on the arm were -- the center of the chest and the abdomen -- and  how to position themselves to take blows there, against their natural  instincts. The slaves even had time for a mock battle before being sent  out among the cannibals.\nThe slaves handled themselves admirably. Very few, just fifteen slaves,  were killed and eaten out right. Only ten were killed and eaten when  they reached the river. That was when things did not go according to  Arslic Oan's plans. Twenty-one slaves with jars of water took off for  the hills. Only eight returned to the castle, largely because they were  blocked by the cannibal Nords. It was a larger percentage than he had  anticipated surviving, but Arslic Oan felt righteous indignation at the  paucity of loyalty.\n\"Are you absolutely certain you wouldn't rather flee?\" he hollered from  the battlements.\nFinally, he allowed the survivors in. Three had been killed waiting for  the gate to open. Two more died almost upon stepping into the courtyard.  One was delirious, walking around in circles, laughing and dancing  before suddenly collapsing. That meant five jars of water for four  people, the two surviving slaves, Arslic Oan, and Gorkith. As the lord  of the manor, Arslic Oan took the extra jar, but he was democratic with  the others.\n\"You're quite correct,\" frowned Garaz. \"This story is getting more and  more appalling.\"\n\"Just wait,\" smiled Hallgerd.\nThe next morning (Hallgerd continued) Arslic Oan awoke to a perfectly  still and quiet stronghold. There was no murmuring in the corridors, no  sound of hard labor in the courtyard. He dressed and surveyed the scene.  It appeared that the fortress was utterly deserted. Arslic Oan walked  down to the armorer's quarters, but the door was locked.\n\"Open up,\" said Arslic Oan, patiently. \"We need to speak. Thirty out of  fifty-four slaves successfully made it to the river and gathered water.  Admittedly, some then fled, and a couple didn't survive because I needed  to correct their fickleness, but mathematically, that's a fifty-five  percent survival rate. If you and I and the two remaining slaves made  the next run to the river, we two should survive.\"\n\"Zilian and Gelo left last night with their armor,\" cried Gorklith  through the door.\n\"Who are Zilian and Gelo?\"\n\"The two remaining slaves! They don't remain anymore!\"\n\"Well, that's vexing,\" said Arslic Oan. \"Still we must continue on.  Mathematically--\"\n\"I heard something last night,\" whimpered Gorklith in a funny voice.  \"Like footsteps, only different, and they were moving through the walls.  And there were voices too. They sounded strange, like they couldn't  move their jaws very well, but I knew one.\"\nArslic Oan sighed, humoring his poor armorer: \"And who was it?\"\n\"Ponik.\"\n\"And who is Ponik?\"\n\"One of the slaves that died when the Nords poisoned our water. One of  the many, many slaves that died, and we made use of. He was always a  nice, uncomplaining fellow, that's why I noticed his voice above all the  others,\" Gorklith began to sob. \"I understood what he was saying.\"\n\"Which was what?\" asked Arslic Oan with a sigh.\n\"'Give me back my bones!'\" Gorklith's voice shrieked. There was silence  for a moment, and then more hysterical sobbing.\n\"I saw that coming,\" laughed Xiomara.\nThere was nothing more to be done with the armorer for the time being  (said Hallgerd, a trifle annoyed at the regular interruptions), so  Arslic Oan stripped one of the dead slaves of his suit of bonemold and  put it on. He practiced in the courtyard, impressing himself with his  natural comfortably with medium weight armor. For hours, he boxed,  feinted, dodged, sprinted, skipped, jumped, and generally cavorted  about. When he felt tired, he retired to the shade and took a nap.\nThe sound of the king's trumpet woke him with a start. Night had fallen,  and for a moment, he thought he had been dreaming. Then the alarum  sounded again, far in the distance, but clear. Arslic Oan leapt to his  feet and ran to the ramparts. Several miles away, he could see the  emissaries and their vast and well-armed escort approach. They were  there early! The cannibal Nords below looked at one another with  consternation. Savages they might be, but they knew when a superior  force was approaching.\nArslic Oan joyously dashed down the stairs to Gorklith's chamber. The  door was still locked. He beat on it, cajoling, demanding, threatening.  Finally, he found a key, one of the few scraps of metal that had not  been smelted days before.\nGorklith appeared to be sleeping, but as Arslic Oan approached, he  noticed that the armorer's mouth and eyes were wide open and his arms  were folded unnaturally behind his back. On closer inspection, the  armorer was obviously dead. What was more, his face and whole body were  sunken, like an empty pig's bladder.\nSomething moved through the walls, like a footfall only... squishy.  Arslic Oan expertly and gracefully turned to face it, completely in  balance.\nAt first, it seemed like nothing more than a bubble expanding through  one of the cracks in the stone. As more of the flesh-colored gelatinous  matter emerged, it more clearly resembled part of a face. A flaccid,  almost shapeless face with a low brow and a slack, toothless jaw. The  rest of the body oozed out of the crack, a soft bag of muscle and blood.  Behind Arslic Oan and to the side, there was more movement, more slaves  welling up through the cracks in the stone. They were all around him,  reaching out.\n\"Give us,\" moaned Ponik, his tongue rolling about his hanging jaw. \"Give  us back our bones.\"\nArslic Oan began to rip off his bonemold, throwing it to the floor. A  hundred figures, more, pooled into the small chamber.\n\"That's not enough.\"\nThe cannibals had cleared away by the time the king's emissaries arrived  at Arslic Oan's gates. They had not been looking forward to this visit.  It was best, they though philosophically, to begin with the worst of  the king's noblemen, so to end their trip well. They sounded the alarum  once again, but the gates did not open. There was no sound from Arslic  Oan's stronghold.\nIt took a few hours to gain access. If the emissaries had not brought a  professional acrobat with them for entertainment, it might have taken  longer. The place seemed to be abandoned. They searched every room,  until finally they came to the armorer's.\nThere they found the master of the manor, folded neatly, legs behind his  head, arms behind the legs, like a fine gown. Not a bone in his body.\n\"The first part of your story was complete nonsense,\" cried Xiomara.  \"But now it doesn't hold true on any level. How could bonemold be made  again if the armorer who invented it died before he could tell anyone  how he did it?\"\n\"I said that this was the first time it was created, not the first time  people learned the craft.\"\n\"And when did someone first teach someone else the craft?\" asked Garaz.\n\"That, my friends,\" replied Hallgerd with a sinister smile. \"Is a tale  for another night.\""

    "text": "The Book of the Dragonborn\nby\n\tPrior Emelene Madrine\n\tOrder of Talos\n\tWeynon Priory\nYear 360 of the Third Era,\n\tTwenty-First of the Reign of\n\tHis Majesty Pelagius IV\nMany people have heard the term \"Dragonborn\" - we are of course ruled by the \"Dragonborn Emperors\" - but the true meaning of the term is not commonly understood. For those of us in the Order of Talos, this is a subject near and dear to our hearts, and in this book I will attempt to illuminate the history and significance of those known as Dragonborn down through the ages.\nMost scholars agree that the term was first used in connection with the Covenant of Akatosh, when the blessed St. Alessia was given the Amulet of Kings and the Dragonfires in the Temple of the One were first lit. \"Akatosh, looking with pity upon the plight of men, drew precious blood from his own heart, and blessed St. Alessia with this blood of Dragons, and made a Covenant that so long as Alessia's generations were true to the dragon blood, Akatosh would endeavor to seal tight the Gates of Oblivion, and to deny the armies of daedra and undead to their enemies, the Daedra-loving Ayleids.\" Those blessed by Akatosh with \"the dragon blood\" became known more simply as Dragonborn.\nThe connection with the rulers of the Empire was thus there from the beginning - only those of the dragon blood were able to wear the Amulet of Kings and light the Dragonfires. All the legitimate rulers of the Empire have been Dragonborn - the Emperors and Empresses of the first Cyrodilic Empire founded by Alessia; Reman Cyrodiil and his heirs; and of course Tiber Septim and his heirs, down to our current Emperor, His Majesty Pelagius Septim IV.\nBecause of this connection with the Emperors, however, the other significance of the Dragonborn has been obscured and largely forgotten by all but scholars and those of us dedicated to the service of the blessed Talos, Who Was Tiber Septim. Very few realize that being Dragonborn is not a simple matter of heredity - being the blessing of Akatosh Himself, it is beyond our understanding exactly how and why it is bestowed. Those who become Emperor and light the Dragonfires are surely Dragonborn - the proof is in the wearing of the Amulet and the lighting of the Fires. But were they Dragonborn and thus able to do these things - or was the doing the sign of the blessing of Akatosh descending upon them? All that we can say is that it is both, and neither - a divine mystery.\nThe line of Septims have all been Dragonborn, of course, which is one reason the simplistic notion of it being hereditary has become so commonplace. But we know for certain that the early Cyrodilic rulers were not all related. There is also no evidence that Reman Cyrodiil was descended from Alessia, although there are many legends that would make it so, most of them dating from the time of Reman and likely attempts to legitimize his rule. We know that the Blades, usually thought of as the Emperor's bodyguards, originated in Akaviri crusaders who invaded Tamriel for obscure reasons in the late First Era. They appear to have been searching for a Dragonborn - the events at Pale Pass bear this out - and the Akaviri were the first to proclaim Reman Cyrodiil as Dragonborn. In fact it was the Akaviri who did the most to promote his standing as Emperor (although Reman himself never took that title in his lifetime). And of course there is no known hereditary connection between Tiber Septim and any of the previous Dragonborn rulers of Tamriel.\nWhether there can be more than one Dragonborn at any time is another mystery. The Emperors have done their best to dismiss this notion, but of course the Imperial succession itself means that at the very least there are two or more potential Dragonborn at any time: the current ruler and his or her heirs. The history of the Blades also hints at this - although little is known of their activities during the Interregnum between Reman's Empire and the rise of Tiber Septim, many believe that the Blades continued to search out and guard those they believed were (or might be) Dragonborn during this time.\nLastly, we come to the question of the true meaning of being Dragonborn. The connection with dragons is so obvious that it has almost been forgotten - in these days when dragons are a distant memory, we forget that in the early days being Dragonborn meant having \"the dragon blood\". Some scholars believe that was meant quite literally, although the exact significance is not known. The Nords tell tales of Dragonborn heroes who were great dragonslayers, able to steal the power of the dragons they killed. Indeed, it is well known that the Akaviri sought out and killed many dragons during their invasion, and there is some evidence that this continued after they became Reman Cyrodiil's Dragonguard (again, the connection to dragons) - the direct predecessor to the Blades of today.\nI leave you with what is known as \"The Prophecy of the Dragonborn\". It often said to originate in an Elder Scroll, although it is sometimes also attributed to the ancient Akaviri. Many have attempted to decipher it, and many have also believed that its omens had been fulfilled and that the advent of the \"Last Dragonborn\" was at hand. I make no claims as an interpreter of prophecy, but it does suggest that the true significance of Akatosh's gift to mortalkind has yet to be fully understood.\nWhen misrule takes its place at the eight corners of the world\nWhen the Brass Tower walks and Time is reshaped\nWhen the thrice-blessed fail and the Red Tower trembles\nWhen the Dragonborn Ruler loses his throne, and the White Tower falls\nWhen the Snow Tower lies sundered, kingless, bleeding\nThe World-Eater wakes, and the Wheel turns upon the Last Dragonborn."

    "text": "Brief History of the Empire, v1\nA Brief History\nof the Empire\nPart One\nby \nStronach k'Thojj III\nImperial Historian\nBefore the rule of Tiber Septim, all Tamriel was in chaos.  The poet Tracizis called that period of continuous unrest \"days and nights of blood and venom.\"  The kings were a petty lot of grasping tyrants, who fought Tiber's attempts to bring order to the land.  But they were as disorganized as they were dissolute, and the strong hand of Septim brought peace forcibly to Tamriel.  The year was 2E 896.  The following year, the Emperor declared the beginning of a new Era-thus began the Third Era, Year Aught.\nFor thirty-eight years, the Emperor Tiber reigned supreme.  It was a lawful, pious, and glorious age, when justice was known to one and all, from serf to sovereign.  On Tiber's death, it rained for an entire fortnight as if the land of Tamriel itself was weeping.\nThe Emperor's grandson, Pelagius, came to the throne.  Though his reign was short, he was as strong and resolute as his father had been, and Tamriel could have enjoyed a continuation of the Golden Age.  Alas, an unknown enemy of the Septim Family hired that accursed organization of cutthroats, the Dark Brotherhood, to kill the Emperor Pelagius I as he knelt at prayer at the Temple of the One in the Imperial City.  Pelagius I's reign lasted less than three years.\nPelagius had no living children, so the Crown Imperial passed to his first cousin, the daughter of Tiber's brother Agnorith.  Kintyra, former Queen of Silvenar, assumed the throne as Kintyra I.  Her reign was blessed with prosperity and good harvests, and she herself was an avid patroness of art, music, and dance.\nKintyra's son was crowned after her death, the first Emperor of Tamriel to use the imperial name Uriel.  Uriel I was the great lawmaker of the Septim Dynasty, and a promoter of independent organizations and guilds.  Under his kind but firm hand, the Fighters Guild and the Mages Guild increased in prominence throughout Tamriel.  His son and successor Uriel II reigned for eighteen years, from the death of Uriel I in 3E64 to Pelagius II's accession in 3E82.  Tragically, the rule of Uriel II was cursed with blights, plagues, and insurrections.  The tenderness he inherited from his father did not serve Tamriel well, and little justice was done.\nPelagius II inherited not only the throne from his father, but the debt from the latter's poor financial and judicial management.  Pelagius dismissed all of the Elder Council, and allowed only those willing to pay great sums to resume their seats.  He encouraged similar acts among his vassals, the kings of Tamriel, and by the end of his seventeen year reign, Tamriel had returned to prosperity.  His critics, however, have suggested that any advisor possessed of wisdom but not of gold had been summarily ousted by Pelagius.  This may have led to some of the troubles his son Antiochus faced when he in turn became Emperor.\nAntiochus was certainly one of the more flamboyant members of the usually austere Septim Family.  He had numerous mistresses and nearly as many wives, and was renowned for the grandeur of his dress and his high good humor.  Unfortunately, his reign was rife with civil war, surpassing even that of his grandfather Uriel II.  The War of the Isle in 3E110, twelve years after Antiochus assumed the throne, nearly took the province of Summurset Isle away from Tamriel.  The united alliance of the kings of Summurset and Antiochus only managed to defeat King Orghum of the island-kingdom of Pyandonea due to a freak storm.  Legend credits the Psijic Order of the Isle of Artaeum with the sorcery behind the tempest.\nThe story of Kintyra II, heiress to her father Antiochus' throne, is certainly one of the saddest tales in imperial history.  Her first cousin Uriel, son of Queen Potema of Solitude, accused Kintyra of being a bastard, alluding to the infamous decadence of the Imperial City during her father's reign.  When this accusation failed to stop her coronation, Uriel bought the support of several disgruntled kings of High Rock, Skyrim, and Morrowind, and with Queen Potema's assistance, he coordinated three attacks on the Septim Empire.\nThe first attack occurred in the Iliac Bay region, which separates High Rock and Hammerfell.  Kintyra's entourage was massacred and the Empress taken captive.  For two years, Kintyra II languished in an Imperial prison believed to be somewhere in Glenpoint or Glenmoril before she was slain in her cell under mysterious circumstances.  The second attack was on a series of Imperial garrisons along the coastal Morrowind islands.  The Empress' consort Kontin Arynx fell defending the forts.  The third and final attack was a siege of the Imperial City itself, occurring after the Elder Council had split up the army to attack western High Rock and eastern Morrowind.  The weakened government had little defence against Uriel's determined aggression, and capitulated after only a fortnight of resistance.  Uriel took the throne that same evening and proclaimed himself Uriel III, Emperor of Tamriel.  The year was 3E 121.  Thus began the War of the Red Diamond, described in Volume II of this series.\nBrief History of the Empire, v2\nA Brief History\nof the Empire\nPart Two\nby \nStronach k'Thojj III\nImperial Historian\n\nVolume I of this series described in brief the lives of the first eight Emperors of the Septim Dynasty, beginning with the glorious Tiber Septim and ending with his great, great, great, great, grandniece Kintyra II.  Kintyra's murder in Glenpoint while in captivity is considered by some to be the end of the pure strain of Septim blood in the imperial family.  Certainly it marks the end of something significant.\nUriel III not only proclaimed himself Emperor of Tamriel, but also Uriel Septim III, taking the eminent surname as a title.  In truth, his surname was Mantiarco from his father's line.  In time, Uriel III was deposed and his crimes reviled, but the tradition of taking the name Septim as a title for the Emperor of Tamriel did not die with him.\nFor six years, the War of the Red Diamond (which takes its name from the Septim Family's famous badge) tore the Empire apart.  The combatants were the three surviving children of Pelagius II-Potema, Cephorus, and Magnus-and their various offspring.  Potema, of course, supported her son Uriel III, and had the combined support of all of Skyrim and northern Morrowind.  With the efforts of Cephorus and Magnus, however, the province of High Rock turned coat.  The provinces of Hammerfell, Summurset Isle, Valenwood, Elsweyr, and Black Marsh were divided in their loyalty, but most kings supported Cephorus and Magnus.\nIn 3E127, Uriel III was captured at the Battle of Ichidag in Hammerfell.  En route to his trial in the Imperial City, a mob overtook his prisoner's carriage and burned him alive within it.  His captor and uncle continued on to the Imperial City, and by common acclaim was proclaimed Cephorus I, Emperor of Tamriel.\nCephorus' reign was marked by nothing but war.  By all accounts, he was a kind and intelligent man, but what Tamriel needed was a great warrior -- and he, fortunately, was that.  It took an additional ten years of constant warfare for him to defeat his sister Potema.  The so-called Wolf Queen of Solitude who died in the siege of her city-state in the year 137.  Cephorus survived his sister by only three years.  He never had time during the war years to marry, so it was his brother, the fourth child of Pelagius II, who assumed the throne.\nThe Emperor Magnus was already elderly when he took up the imperial diadem, and the business of punishing the traitorous kings of the War of the Red Diamond drained much of his remaining strength.  Legend accuses Magnus' son and heir Pelagius III of patricide, but that seems highly unlikely-for no other reason than that Pelagius was King of Solitude following the death of Potema, and seldom visited the Imperial City.\nPelagius III, sometimes called Pelagius the Mad, was proclaimed Emperor in the 145th year of the Third Era.  Almost from the start, his eccentricities of behaviour were noted at court.  He embarrassed dignitaries, offended his vassal kings, and on one occasion marked the end of an imperial grand ball by attempting to hang himself.  His long-suffering wife was finally awarded the Regency of Tamriel, and Pelagius III was sent to a series of healing institutions and asylums until his death in 3E153 at the age of thirty-four.\nThe Empress Regent of Tamriel was proclaimed Empress Katariah I upon the death of her husband.  Some who do not mark the end of the Septim bloodline with the death of Kintyra II consider the ascendancy of this Dark Elf woman the true mark of its decline.  Her defenders, on the other hand, assert that though Katariah was not descended from Tiber, the son she had with Pelagius was, so the imperial chain did continue.  Despite racist assertions to the contrary, Katariah's forty-six-year reign was one of the most celebrated in Tamriel's history.  Uncomfortable in the Imperial City, Katariah travelled extensively throughout the Empire such as no Emperor ever had since Tiber's day.  She repaired much of the damage that previous emperor's broken alliances and bungled diplomacy created.  The people of Tamriel came to love their Empress far more than the nobility did.  Katariah's death in a minor skirmish in Black Marsh is a favorite subject of conspiracy minded historians.  The Sage Montalius' discovery, for instance, of a disenfranchised branch of the Septim Family and their involvement with the skirmish was a revelation indeed.\nWhen Cassynder assumed the throne upon the death of his mother, he was already middle-aged.  Only half Elven, he aged like a Breton.  In fact, he had left the rule of Wayrest to his half-brother Uriel due to poor health.  Nevertheless, as the only true blood relation of Pelagius and thus Tiber, he was pressed into accepting the throne.  To no one's surprise, the Emperor Cassynder's reign did not last long.  In two years he joined his predecessors in eternal slumber.\nUriel Lariat, Cassynder's half-brother, and the child of Katariah I and her Imperial consort Gallivere Lariat (after the death of Pelagius III), left the kingdom of Wayrest to reign as Uriel IV.  Legally, Uriel IV was a Septim:  Cassynder had adopted him into the royal family when he had become King of Wayrest.  Nevertheless, to the Council and the people of Tamriel, he was a bastard child of Katariah.  Uriel did not possess the dynamism of his mother, and his long forty-three-year reign was a hotbed of sedition.\nUriel IV's story is told in the third volume of this series.\nBrief History of the Empire, v3\nA Brief History\nof the Empire\nPart Three\nby \nStronach k'Thojj III\nImperial Historian\nThe first volume of this series told in brief the story of the succession of the first eight Emperors of the Septim Dynasty, from Tiber I to Kintyra II.  The second volume described the War of the Red Diamond and the six Emperors that followed its aftermath, from Uriel III to Cassynder I.  At the end of that volume, it was described how the Emperor Cassynder's half-brother Uriel IV assumed the throne of the Empire of Tamriel.\nIt will be recalled that Uriel IV was not a Septim by birth.  His mother, though she reigned as Empress for many years, was a Dark Elf married to a true Septim Emperor, Pelagius III.  Uriel's father was actually Katariah I's consort after Pelagius' death, a Breton nobleman named Gallivere Lariat.  Before taking the throne of Empire, Cassynder I had ruled the kingdom of Wayrest, but poor health had forced him to retire.  Cassynder had no children, so he legally adopted his half-brother Uriel and abdicated the kingdom.  Seven years later, Cassynder inherited the Empire at the death of his mother.  Three years after that, Uriel once again found himself the recipient of Cassynder's inheritance.\nUriel IV's reign was a long and difficult one.  Despite being a legally adopted member of the Septim Family, and despite the Lariat Family's high position -- indeed, they were distant cousins of the Septims -- few of the Elder Council could be persuaded to accept him fully as a blood descendant of Tiber.  The Council had assumed much responsibility during Katariah I's long reign and Cassynder I's short one, and a strong-willed \"alien\" monarch like Uriel IV found it impossible to command their unswerving fealty.  Time and again the Council and Emperor were at odds, and time and again the Council won the battles.  Since the days of Pelagius II, the Elder Council had consisted of the wealthiest men and women in the Empire, and the power they wielded was conclusive.\nThe Council's last victory over Uriel IV was posthumous.  Andorak, Uriel IV's son, was disinherited by vote of Council, and a cousin more closely related to the original Septim line was proclaimed Cephorus II in 3E247.  For the first nine years of Cephorus II's reign, those loyal to Andorak battled the Imperial forces.  In an act that the Sage Eraintine called \"Tiber Septim's heart beating no more,\" the Council granted Andorak the High Rock kingdom of Shornhelm to end the war, and Andorak's descendants still rule there.\nBy and large, Cephorus II had foes that demanded more of his attention than Andorak.  \"From out of a cimmerian nightmare,\" in the words of Eraintine, a man who called himself the Camoran Usurper led an army of Daedra and undead warriors on a rampage through Valenwood, conquering kingdom after kingdom.  Few could resist his onslaughts, and as month turned to bloody month in the year 3E249, even fewer tried.  Cephorus II sent more and more mercenaries into Hammerfell to stop the Usurper's northward march, but they were bribed or slaughtered and raised as undead.\nThe story of the Camoran Usurper deserves a book of its own.  (It is recommended that the reader find Palaux Illthre's The Fall of the Usurper for more detail.)  In short, however, the destruction of the forces of the Usurper had little do with the efforts of the Emperor.  The result was a great regional victory and an increase in hostility toward the seemingly inefficacious Empire.\nUriel V, Cephorus II's son and successor, swivelled opinion back toward the latent power of the Empire.  Turning the attention of Tamriel away from internal strife, Uriel V embarked on a series of invasions beginning almost from the moment he took the throne in 3E268.  Uriel V conquered Roscrea in 271, Cathnoquey in 276, Yneslea in 279, and Esroniet in 284.  In 3E288, he embarked on his most ambitious enterprise, the invasion of the continent kingdom of Akavir.  This ultimately proved a failure, for two years later Uriel V was killed in Akavir on the battlefield of Ionith.  Nevertheless, Uriel V holds a reputation second only to Tiber as one of the two great Warrior Emperors of Tamriel.\nThe last four Emperors, beginning with Uriel V's infant son, are described in the fourth and final volume of this series.\nBrief History of the Empire, v4\nA Brief History\nof the Empire\nPart Four\nby \nStronach k'Thojj III\nImperial Historian\nThe first book of this series described, in brief, the first eight Emperors of the Septim Dynasty beginning with Tiber I.  The second volume described the War of the Red Diamond and the six Emperors who followed.  The third volume described the troubles of the next three Emperors-the frustrated Uriel IV, the ineffectual Cephorus II, and the heroic Uriel V.\nOn Uriel V's death across the sea in distant, hostile Akavir, Uriel VI was but five years old.  In fact, Uriel VI was born only shortly before his father left for Akavir.  Uriel V's only other progeny, by a morganatic alliance, were the twins Morihatha and Eloisa, who had been born a month after Uriel V left.  Uriel VI was crowned in the 290th year of the Third Era.  The Imperial Consort Thonica, as the boy's mother, was given a restricted Regency until Uriel VI reached his majority.  The Elder Council retained the real power, as they had ever since the days of Katariah I.\nThe Council so enjoyed its unlimited and unrestricted freedom to promulgate laws (and generate profits) that Uriel VI was not given full license to rule until 307, when he was already 22 years old.  He had been slowly assuming positions of responsibility for years, but both the Council and his mother, who enjoyed even her limited Regency, were loath to hand over the reins.  By the time he came to the throne, the mechanisms of government gave him little power except for that of the imperial veto.\nThis power, however, he regularly and vigorously exercised.  By 313, Uriel VI could boast with conviction that he truly did rule Tamriel.  He utilized defunct spy networks and guard units to bully and coerce the difficult members of the Elder Council.  His half-sister Morihatha was (not surprisingly) his staunchest ally, especially after her marriage to Baron Ulfe Gersen of Winterhold brought her considerable wealth and influence.  As the Sage Ugaridge said, \"Uriel V conquered Esroniet, but Uriel VI conquered the Elder Council.\"\nWhen Uriel VI fell off a horse and could not be resuscitated by the finest Imperial healers, his beloved sister Morihatha took up the imperial tiara.  At 25 years of age, she had been described by (admittedly self-serving) diplomats as the most beautiful creature in all of Tamriel.  She was certainly well-learned, vivacious, athletic, and a well-practised politician.  She brought the Archmagister of Skyrim to the Imperial City and created the second Imperial Battlemage since the days of Tiber Septim.\nMorihatha finished the job her brother had begun, and made the Imperial Province a true government under the Empress (and later, the Emperor).  Outside the Imperial Province, however, the Empire had been slowly disintegrating.  Open revolutions and civil wars had raged unchallenged since the days of her grandfather Cephorus II.  Carefully coordinating her counterattacks, Morihatha slowly claimed back her rebellious vassals, always avoiding overextending herself.\nThough Morihatha's military campaigns were remarkably successful, her deliberate pace often frustrated the Council.  One Councilman, an Argonian who took the Colovian name of Thoricles Romus, furious at her refusal to send troops to his troubled Black Marsh, is commonly believed to have hired the assassins who claimed her life in 3E 339.  Romus was summarily tried and executed, though he protested his innocence to the last.\nMorihatha had no surviving children, and Eloisa had died of a fever four years before.  Eloisa's 25-year-old son Pelagius was thus crowned Pelagius IV.  Pelagius IV continued his aunt's work, slowly bringing back under his wing the radical and refractory kingdoms, duchies, and baronies of the Empire.  He exercised Morihatha's poise and circumspect pace in his endeavours-but alas, he did not attain her success.  The kingdoms had been free of constraint for so long that even a benign Imperial presence was considered odious.  Nevertheless, when Pelagius died after a notably stable and prosperous twenty-nine-year reign, Tamriel was closer to unity than it had been since the days of Uriel I.\nOur current Emperor, His Awesome and Terrible Majesty, Uriel Septim VII, son of Pelagius IV, has the diligence of his great-aunt Morihatha, the political skill of his great-uncle Uriel VI, and the military prowess of his great grand-uncle Uriel V.  For twenty-one years he reigned and brought justice and order to Tamriel.  In the year 3E389, however, his Imperial Battlemage, Jagar Tharn, betrayed him.\nUriel VII was imprisoned in a dimension of Tharn's creation, and Tharn used his sorcery of illusion to assume the Emperor's aspect.  For the next ten years, Tharn abused imperial privilege but did not continue Uriel VII's schedule of reconquest.  It is not yet entirely known what Tharn's goals and personal accomplishments were during the ten years he masqueraded as his liege lord.  In 3E399, an enigmatic Champion defeated the Battlemage in the dungeons of the Imperial Palace and freed Uriel VII from his other-dimensional jail.\nSince his emancipation, Uriel Septim VII has worked diligently to renew the battles that would reunite Tamriel.  Tharn's interference broke the momentum, it is true -- but the years since then have proven that there is hope of the Golden Age of Tiber Septim's rule glorifying Tamriel once again."

He decided he would save some gold and decided to cross the pine forest on foot.\nThe first day of his journey was rather uneventful,  the soldier stuck to the main path and kept a brisk pace.   When it started getting dark he setup his bedroll, built a small fire and cooked up some rabbit he had caught.  \"A fine day indeed\" he thought to himself as he fell asleep.\nPartway through the evening the soldier was woken up by soft sobbing in the distance.  He grabbed his sword assuming it to be a bandit trick, but pretended to sleep so he could get the jump on them.  After a few minutes the sobbing started moving away from his camp until he could no longer hear it.  For the rest of the night slept with one eye open.\nDay two the soldier awoke from what rotten sleep he could catch and started off through the forest at a quicker pace, intending to put distance between himself and whatever he had heard last night.  As the day went on it began to rain heavy so the soldier built himself a little shelter for the evening so he could remain dry while he slept.\nIt took him a little longer to fall asleep with thoughts of the previous night fresh in his mind but he eventually slept.\nThis time he awoke to sobbing that sounded like it was right outside his shelter.  The soldier grabbed his sword and crawled out of the shelter.  In front of the fire he saw the back of a ghostly woman sobbing into her hands.\nThe soldier mustered his courage and asked her what was wrong.\nNo answer.\nHe began to slowly approach but before he could reach her she turned and screamed at him.  The ghostly woman raised an axe and began to run at the soldier, disappearing before she made contact.\nThe soldier took off into the night with just his sword in hand.  He ran until the first light of dawn where he started down the road again, as fast as he could move.\nThe third day was bright and sunny, but the soldier, rattled and sleepless, didn't even notice.  He moved as fast as he could trying to get through the forest before nightfall.\nAs darkness began to fall he saw a cabin just off the road and thought to himself it would be a good place to hunker down for the night.  After arriving at the cabin he spent some time blocking the doors and windows, nothing would get in.\nDespite his preparations, he could not sleep.  He sat in what used to be the cabin's bedroom staring at the barricaded door shaking.  Eventually he could keep his eyes open no longer and fell asleep.\nThis time he awoke to laughing on the other side of the barricaded door.  It sounded like the woman from before, but he refused to believe it was her.\nThe soldier burst through the barricaded door into the main room to find the ghostly woman from the night before staring at the ground laughing hysterically with axe in hand.\nHe began to relentlessly attack the ghostly woman but he could feel his strikes were less effective.  He used a scroll of firebolt which drew a scream from her and she exploded, disappearing.\nThe ordeal was over, the ghost was gone.\nThe soldier slept well that night and the next day made excellent distance through the woods.  As the sun began to set he came out on the other side of the forest and looked back, remembering the days before.\nAs he turned and started walking away from the woods he could swear he heard the sobbing again.\n"

I have also seen it pounce forward on its prey in a particularly powerful attack.\nThe snowy version of the sabrecat has spotted white fur which I believe it uses more for stalking more than its cousin in the plains.\nThe tooth of the cat is rumored to be useful in potions that restore the imbibers stamina as well as a potion that will temporarily give a more keen eye for smithing.\nAn skillful hunter can usually salvage the pelts and teeth of their kill, but report that the meat is tasteless and not fit to eat."

    "text": "Chance's Folly\nby\n\tZylmoc Golge\nBy the time she was sixteen, Minevah Iolos had been an unwelcome guest in every shop and manor in Balmora. Sometimes, she would take everything of value within; other times, it was enough to experience the pure pleasure of finding a way past the locks and traps. In either situation, she would leave a pair of dice in a prominent location as her calling card to let the owners know who had burgled them. The mysterious ghost became known to the locals as Chance.\nA typical conversation in Balmora at this time:\n\"My dear, whatever happened to that marvelous necklace of yours?\"\n\"My dear, it was taken by Chance.\"\nThe only time when Chance disliked her hobby was when she miscalculated, and she came upon an owner or a guard. So far, she had never been caught, or even seen, but dozens of times she had uncomfortably close encounters. There came a day when she felt it was time to expand her reach. She considered going to Vivec or Gnisis, but one night at the Eight Plates, she heard a tale of the Heran Ancestral Tomb, an ancient tomb filled with traps and possessing hundreds of years of the Heran family treasures.\nThe idea of breaking the spell of the Heran Tomb and gaining the fortune within appealed to Chance, but facing the guardians was outside of her experience. While she was considering her options, she saw Ulstyr Moresby sitting at a table nearby, by himself as usual. He was huge brute of a Breton who had a reputation as a gentle eccentric, a great warrior who had gone mad and paid more attention to the voices in his head than to the world around him.\nIf she must have a partner in this enterprise, Chance decided, this man would be perfect. He would not demand or understand the concept of getting an equal share of the booty. If worse came to worse, he would not be missed if the inhabitants of the Heran Tomb were too much for him. Or if Chance found his company tiresome and elected to leave him behind.\n\"Ulstyr, I don't think we've ever met, but my name is Minevah,\" she said, approaching the table. \"I'm fancying a trip to the Heran Ancestral Tomb. If you think you could handle the monsters, I could take care of unlocking doors and popping traps. What do you think?\"\nThe Breton took a moment to reply, as if considering the counsel of the voices in his head. Finally he nodded his head in the affirmative, mumbling, \"Yes, yes, yes, prop a rock, hot steel. Chitin. Walls beyond doors. Fifty-three. Two months and back.\"\n\"Splendid,\" said Chance, not the least put off by his rambling. \"We'll leave early tomorrow.\"\nWhen Chance met Ulstyr the next morning, he was wearing chitin armor and had armed himself with an unusual blade that glowed faintly of enchantment. As they began their trek, she tried to engage him in conversation, but his responses were so nonsensical that she quickly abandoned the attempts. A sudden rainstorm swelled over the plain, dousing them, but as she was wearing no armor and Ulstyr was wearing slick chitin, their progress was not impeded.\nInto the dark recesses of the Heran Tomb, they delved. Her instincts had been correct -- they made very good partners.\nShe recognized the ancient snap-wire traps, deadfalls, and brittle backs before they were triggered, and cracked all manners of lock: simple tumbler, combination, twisted hasp, double catch, varieties from antiquity with no modern names, rusted heaps that would have been dangerous to open even if one possessed the actual key.\nUlstyr for his part slew scores of bizarre fiends, the likes of which Chance, a city girl, had never seen before. His enchanted blade's spell of fire was particularly effective against the Frost Atronachs. He even saved her when she lost her footing and nearly plummeted into a shadowy crack in the floor.\n\"Not to hurt thyself,\" he said, his face showing genuine concern. \"There are walls beyond doors and fifty-three. Drain ring. Two months and back. Prop a rock. Come, Mother Chance.\"\nChance had not been listening to much of Ulstyr's babbling, but when he said \"Chance,\" she was startled. She had introduced herself to him as Minevah. Could it be that the peasants were right, and that when mad men spoke, they were talking to the daedra prince Sheogorath who gave them advice and information beyond their ken? Or was it rather, more sensibly, that Ulstyr was merely repeating what he heard tell of in Balmora where in recent years \"Chance\" had become synonymous with lockpicking?\nAs the two continued on, Chance thought of Ulstyr's mumblings. He had said \"chitin\" when they met as if it had just occurred to him, and the chitin armor that he wore had proven useful. Likewise, \"hot steel.\" What could \"walls beyond doors\" mean? Or \"two months and back\"? What numbered \"fifty-three\"?\nThe notion that Ulstyr possessed secret knowledge about her and the tomb they were in began to unnerve Chance. She made up her mind then to abandon her companion once the treasure had been found. He had cut through the living and undead guardians of the dungeon: if she merely left by the path they had entered, she would be safe without a defender.\nOne phrase he said made perfect sense to her: \"drain ring.\" At one of the manors in Balmora, she had picked up a ring purely because she thought it was pretty. It was not until later that she discovered that it could be used to sap other people's vitality. Could Ulstyr be aware of this? Would he be taken by surprise if she used it on him?\nShe formulated her plan on how best to desert the Breton as they continued down the hall. Abruptly the passage ended with a large metal door, secured by a golden lock. Using her pick, Chance snapped away the two tumblers and bolt, and swung the door open. The treasure of the Heran Tomb was within.\nChance quietly slipped her glove off her hand, exposing the ring as she stepped into the room. There were fifty-three bags of gold within. As she turned, the door closed between her and the Breton. On her side, it did not resemble a door anymore, but a wall. Walls beyond doors.\nFor many days, Chance screamed and screamed, as she tried to find a way out of the room. For some days after that, she listened dully to the laughter of Sheogorath within her own head. Two months later, when Ulstyr returned, she was dead. He used a rock to prop open the door and remove the gold."

So one day Boethiah, Prince of Plots, precocious youth, tricked Trinimac to go into his mouth. Boethiah talked like Trinimac for awhile then, and gathered enough people to listen to him. Boethiah showed them the lies of the et'Ada, the Aedra, and told them Trinimac was the biggest liar of all, saying all this with Trinimac's voice! Boethiah told the mass before him the Tri-Angled Truth. He showed them, with Mephala, the rules of Psijic Endeavor. He taught them how to build Houses, and what items they needed to bury in the Corners. He demonstrated the right way to wear their skin. He performed the way to walk to achieve an Exodus. Then Boethiah relieved himself of Trinimac right there on the ground before them to prove all the things he said were the truth. It was easy then for his new people to become the Changed Ones."

    "text": "Charwich-Koniinge Letters, v1\n6 Suns Height, 3E 411\nKambria, High Rock\nMy Dear Koniinge,\nI hope this letter reaches you in Sadrith Mora.  It's been many weeks since I've heard from you, and I hope that the address that I have for you is still up-to-date.  I gave the courier some extra gold, so if he doesn't find you, he is to make inquiries to your whereabouts.  As you can see, after a rather tedious crossing, I've at long last made my way from Bhoriane to my favorite principality in High Rock, surprisingly literate and always fascinating Kambria.  I at once ensconced myself in one of the better libraries here, becoming reacquainted with the locals and the lore.  At the risk of being overly optimistic, I think I might have struck on something very interesting about this mysterious fellow, Hadwaf Neithwyr.\nMany here in town remember him, though few very fondly.  When Hadwaf Neithwyr left, so too did a great plague.  No one thinks it a coincidence.\nAccording to my contacts here, Azura is not his only master.  It may be that when he summoned forth the Daedra and accepted her Star, he was doing so for someone named Baliasir.  Apparently, Neithwyr worked for this Baliasir in some capacity, but I never could find out from anyone exactly what Baliasir's line of business was, nor what Neithwyr did for him.  Zenithar, the God of Work and Commerce, is the most revered deity in Kambria, which served my (that is to say our) purposes well, as the people are naturally receptive to bribery.  Still, it did me little good. I could find nothing specific about our quarry.  After days of inquiry, an old crone recommended that I go to a nearby village called Grimtry Garden, and find the cemetery caretaker there.  I set off at once.\nI know you are impatient when it comes to details, and have little taste for Breton architecture, but if you ever find yourself in mid-High Rock, you owe it to yourself to visit this quaint village.  Like a number of other similar towns in High Rock, there is a high wall surrounded it.  As well as being picturesque, it's a remnant of the region's turbulent past and a useful barrier against the supernatural creatures that sometimes stalk the countryside.  More about that in a moment.\nThe cemetery is actually outside of the city gates, I discovered.  The locals warned me to wait until morning to speak to the caretaker, but I was impatient for information, and did not want to waste a moment.  I trekked through the woods to the lonely graveyard, and immediately found the shuffling, elderly man who was the caretaker.  He bade me leave, that the land was haunted and if I chose to stay I would be in the greatest danger.  I told him that I would not go until he told me what he knew about Hadwaf Neithwyr and his patron Baliasir.  On hearing their names, he fled deeper into the jumble of broken tombstones and decrepit mausoleums.  I naturally pursued.\nI saw him scramble down into an enormous crypt and gave chase.  There was no light within, but I had planned enough to bring with me a torch.  The minute I lit it, I heard a long, savage howl pierce the silence, and I knew that the caretaker had left quickly not merely because he feared speaking of Neithwyr and Baliasir.  Before I saw the creature, I heard its heavy breath and the clack of its clawed feet on stone moving closer to me.  The werewolf emerged from the gloom, brown and black, with slavering jaws, looking at me with the eyes of the cemetery caretaker, now given only to animal hunger.\nI instantly had three different instinctive reactions.  The first was, of course, flight.  The second was to fight.  But if I fled, I might never find the caretaker again, and learn what he knew.  If I fought, I might injure or even kill the creature and be even worse off.  So I elected to go with my third option: to hold my ground and keep the creature within its tomb until the night became morning, and the caretaker resumed his humanity.\nI've sparred often enough unarmored, but surely never with so much at stake, and never with so savage an opponent.  My mind was always on danger not only of injury but the dread disease of lycanthropy. Every rake of its claw I parried, every snap of its foaming jaws I ducked.  I sidestepped when it tried to rush me, but closed the distance to keep it from escaping into the night.  For hours we fought, I always on the defense, it always trying to free itself, or slay me, or both.  I have no doubt that a werewolf has greater energy reserves than a man, but it is a beast and does not know how to save and temper its movements.  As the dawn rose, we were both nearly unconscious from fatigue, but I received my reward.  The creature became a man once again.\nHe was quite considerably friendlier than he had been before.  In fact, when he realized that I had prevented him from going on his nocturnal rampage through the countryside, he became positively affable.\nHere's what I learned: Neithwyr never returned to High Rock.  As far as the old man knows, he is still in Morrowind.  I visited the gravesite of his sister Peryra, and learned that it was probably through her that Neithwyr first met his patron.  It would seem that she was quite a well-known courtesan in her day, and very well traveled, though she chose to return home to die.  Unlike Neithwyr, Baliasir is not far away from me.  He is a shadowy character, but lately, according to the caretaker, he has been paying court to Queen Elysana in Wayrest.  I leave at once.\nPlease write to me as soon as possible to tell me of your progress.  I should be in Wayrest at the home of my friend Lady Elysbetta Moorling in a week's time.  If Baliasir is at court, Lady Moorling will be able to arrange an introduction.\nI feel confident in saying that we are very close to Azura's Star.\nYour Friend,\nCharwich\nCharwich-Koniinge Letters, v2\n3 Last Seed, 3E 411\nTel Aruhn, Morrowind\nMy Good Friend Charwich,\nI only just last week received your letter dated 6 Sun's Height, addressed to me in Sadrith Mora. I did not know how to reach you before to tell you of my progress finding Hadwaf Neithwyr, so I send this to you now care of the lady you mentioned in your letter, the Lady Elysbetta Moorling of Wayrest. I hope that if you have left her palace, she will know where you've gone and can send this to you. And I hope further that you receive it in a timelier manner that I received your letter. It is essential that I hear from you soon so we may coordinate our next course of action.\nMy adventures here have two acts, one before I received your letter, and one immediately after. While you searched for the elusive possessor of Azura's Star in his homeland to the west, I searched for him here where we understood he conjured up the Daedra Prince and received from her the artifact.\nLike you, I had little difficulty finding people who had heard of or even knew Neithwyr. In fact, not long after we parted company and you left for the Iliac Bay, I met someone who knew where he went to perform the ceremony, so I left at once to come here to Tel Aruhn. It took some time to locate my contact, for he is a Dissident Priest named Minerath. The Temple and Tribunal, the real powers of Morrowind, tend to frown on his Order, and while they haven't begun so much of crusade to stamp them out, there are certainly rumors that they will soon. This tends to make priests like Minerath skittish and paranoid. Difficult people to set appointments with.\nFinally I was told that he would be willing to talk to me at the Plot and Plaster, a tiny tavern without even a room to rent. Downstairs, there were several cloaked men crammed around the tavern's only table, and they searched me to see if I had any weaponry. Of course, I hadn't. You know that isn't my preferred method of doing business.\nWhen it decided that I was harmless, one of the cloaked figures revealed himself to be Minerath. I paid him the gold I promised and asked him what he knew about Hadwaf Neithwyr. He remembered him well enough, saying that after he received the Star, the lad intended to return to High Rock. It seemed he had unfinished business there, presumably of a violent nature, which Azura's Star would facilitate. He had no other information, and I did not know what else to ask.\nWe parted company and I waited for your letter, hoping you had found Neithwyr and perhaps even the Star. I confess that as I lingered in Morrowind and never heard from you, I began to have doubts about your character. You'll forgive me for saying so, but I began to fear that you had taken the artifact for yourself. In fact, I was making plans to come to High Rock myself when your letter came at last.\nThe tale of your adventure in the cemetery at Grimtry Garden, and the information you gathered from the lycanthropic caretaker inspired me to have another meeting with Minerath. Thus began the second act of my story.\nI returned to the Pot and Plaster, reasoning that the priest must frequent that area of the city to feel so comfortable setting clandestine meetings there. It took some time searching, but I finally found him, and as luck would have it, he was alone. I called his name, and he quickly drew me to a dark alleyway, nervous that we would be seen by a Temple ordinator.\nIt is a rare and beautiful thing when a victim insists on dragging his killer to a remote location.\nI began at once asking about this fellow you mentioned, Neithwyr's mysterious patron Baliasir. He denied ever having heard the name. We were still in that easy, fairly conversational state when I attacked the priest. Of course, he was completely taken by surprise. In some ways, that can be more effective than an ambush from behind. No matter how many times I've done it, no one ever expected the friendly man they're talking to grip them by the neck.\nI pressed hard against my favorite spot in the soft part of the throat, just below the thyroid cartilage, and it took him too long to react to my lunge and try pushing back. He began to lose consciousness, and I whispered that if I released my grip a little so he could talk and breath, but he tried to call for help, I would snap his neck. He nodded, and I relaxed the pressure, just a bit.\nI asked him again about Baliasir, and he shook his head, insisting that he had never heard the name. As frightened as he was, it seemed most likely that he was telling the truth, so I asked him more generally if he knew anyone else who might know something about Hadwaf Neithwyr. He told me that there was a woman present also during the ceremony, someone he introduced as his sister.\nI remembered then the part of your letter about seeing the grave of Neithwyr's sister, Peryra. When I mentioned the name to the priest he nodded frantically, but I could see that the interrogation had reached an ending. There is, after all, something about being throttled that causes a man to answer yes to every question. I snapped Minerath's neck, and returned home.\nSo now I'm again unsure how to proceed. I've made several more inquiries and several of the same people who met Neithwyr remember him being with a woman. A few recall him saying that she was his sister. One or two believe they remember her name as being Peryra, though they're not certain. No one, however, has heard of anyone named Baliasir.\nIf I do not hear word from you in response to this in the next couple of weeks, I will come to High Rock, because it's there that most people believe Neithwyr returned. I will only stay here long enough to see if there are other inquiries I can make only in Morrowind to bring us closer to our goal of recovering Azura's Star.\nYour Friend,\nKoniinge\nCharwich-Koniinge Letters, v3\n13 Last Seed, 3E 411\nWayrest, High Rock\nMy Dear Koniinge,\nPlease forgive the quality of the handwriting on this note, but I have not long to live. I can only reply in detail to one part of your letter, and that is that I fear Baliasir, contrary to what you've heard, is very much real. Had he been but a figment of that caretaker's imagination, I would not be feeling life ebb from me as I write this.\nLady Moorling has sent for healers, but I know they won't arrive in time. I just need to explain what happened so that you'll understand, and then all my affairs in this world will be ended. The one advantage of my condition is that I must be brief, without my habitually ornamental descriptions of people and places. I know that you will appreciate that at least.\nIt started when I came to Wayrest, and through my friend Lady Moorling and her court connections was introduced to Baliasir himself. I had to proceed carefully, not wanting him to know of our designs on Azura's Star which I presumed he possessed, given to him by his servant Hadwaf Neithwyr. His function in Queen Elysana's court seemed to be decorative, like so many of her courtiers, and it was not hard to differentiate myself from the others when we began conversing on the school of mysticism. Many of the other hangers-on at the palace can speak eloquently on the subject of the magickal arts, but it seemed that only he and I had deep knowledge of the craft.\nMany a nobleman or adventurer who aren't mages by profession learn a spell or two from the useful schools of restoration or destruction. I told Baliasir quite truthfully that I had never learned any of that (oh, but I wish I knew some healing spells of the school of restoration now), but that I had developed some small skill in mysticism. Not enough to be a Psijic, of course, but in telekinesis, password, and spell reflection I had some amateur ability. He responded with compliments, which allowed me to segue into the topic of another spell of mysticism, the soul trap.\nI told him I was unlearned but curious about that spell. And very naturally and comfortably, I was able to bring up the subject of Azura's Star, the endless well of souls.\nImagine how I had to hold back my excitement when he leaned in and whispered to me, \"If that interests you, come to Klythic's Cairn west of the city tomorrow night.\"\nI couldn't sleep at all. The only thing I could think of was how I would get the Star when he showed it to me. I still knew so little about Baliasir, his past and his power, but the opportunity was too great to let pass. Still, I must admit that I held hopes that you would arrive, as you threatened you might in your letter, so I might have someone of physical strength to aid me in my adventure.\nI am growing weaker and weaker as I write this, so I must proceed with the basic facts. I went to the crypt the following night, and Baliasir led me through the maze of it to the repository where he kept the Star. We were talking quite casually, and as you've so often said, it seemed an excellent time for an ambush. I grabbed the Star and unsheathed my blade in what I felt was amazing speed.\nHe turned to me and I suddenly felt that I was moving like a snail. In a flash, Baliasir changed his form and became his true self, not man or mer, but daedra. A colossal daedra lord who swiped back the Star from my grasp and laughed at my sword as it thudded against his impenetrable hide.\nI knew I had been beaten, and I threw myself towards the corridor. A blue flash of energy coursed through me, flung by Baliasir's claws. At once, I began to feel death. He could have smote me with a thousand spells, but he chose the one where I could lie down, and suffer, and hear him laugh. At the very least, I did not give him that pleasure.\nAlready struck, it was too late for me to cast a counterspell of mysticism, one to dispel the magicka, reflect it or absorb it as my own. But I did still know how to teleport myself, what mystics term 'Recall,' to whatever place I'd last set a spiritual anchor. I confess that at the time, I didn't remember where that would be. Perhaps in Bhoriane when I arrived in the Iliac Bay, or in Kambria, or in Grimtry Garden where I met the caretaker, or my hostess's palace in Wayrest. I prayed that I had not set the anchor last when I was with you in Morrowind, for it said that if the distance is too great, one can be caught between dimensions. Still, I was willing to take that chance, rather than being the plaything of Baliasir.\nI cast the spell and found myself back on the doorstep of Lady Moorling's palace. To be out of the crypt and away from the daedra was a relief, but I had so hoped that I had been smart enough to cast an anchor near a Mages Guild or a temple where I could find a healer. Instead, knowing I was too weak to walk far, I beat on the door and was taken here, where I write this letter, lying in my bed.\nAs I wrote those words, dear Elysbetta, Lady Moorling, came in, quite tearfully and frantic, to tell me the healers should be hre withn but a few minute. But I wil be ded ere they arrve. I know thes are m last wors. Der frend, stay away frm this cursd place.\nYr Frend,\nCharwich\nCharwich-Koniinge Letters, v4\n8 Sun's Dawn, 3E 412\nAmiglith, Summurset Isle\nMy Good Friend, Lord Gemyn,\nYou must forgive me for not meeting you at the palace personally, but I've been unavoidably, tragically detained.  I've left the front gate and door unlocked, and if you're reading this, you must have made it at least as far the antechamber to the east drawing room.  Perhaps you've already wandered the estate and seen some of its delights before coming to this chamber: the seven fountains of marble and porphyry, the reflecting pool, the various groves, the colonnades and quincunx.  I don't think you would have already gone to the second floor suites and the west wing as you would have had to pass this room first, and picked up this letter.  But believe me, they're beautifully appointed with magnificent balustrades, winding staircases, intimate salons, and bedchambers worthy of your affluence.\nThe price of this property is exorbitant, certainly, but for a man like you who seeks only the best, this is the villa you must have.  As you undoubtedly noticed as you arrived through the gates, there are several smaller buildings ideally suited to be guard stations.  I know you are concerned with security.\nI am an intensely greedy man, and there is nothing I would have liked more than to meet you here today, show you the grounds, fawn on you obsequiously, and collect a fat percentage of the cost of the sale when you bought this marvelous palace, as I'm sure you would have.  My dilemma that caused my inexcusable absence began shortly after I arrived here early to make certain the villa was well-cleaned for your inspection.  A man named Koniinge crept up behind me, and gripped me by the throat.  Clamping his left hand over my mouth and nose, and throttling me with his right hand, crushing the soft spot on my throat just below the thyroidal cartilage, he effectively strangled me in a few quick but very painful minutes.\nI am currently buried in a pile of leaves in the north statuary parterre, close to the exceptional sculptural representation of the Transformation of Trinimac.  It should not be too long before I am discovered: someone at my bank will surely notice my absence in due time.  Koniinge might have buried me deeper, but he wanted to be ready for the arrival of his old partner, Charwich.\nPerhaps part of you thinks it best to stop reading now, Lord Gemyn.  You are looking around the antechamber and seeing nothing but doors.  The large one you took to come in from the garden is locked now behind you, and without a better knowledge of the layout of the estate, I could not recommend you attempt to flee down a corridor that might easily come to a dead end.  No.  Much better to keep reading, and see where this is going.\nKoniinge, it seems, was in a partnership with his friend Charwich to try to recover Azura's Star.  They understood it to be in the possession of someone named Hadwaf Neithwyr, a man who conjured up the Daedra Prince Azura herself to acquire it.  As Neithwyr originally haled from High Rock, Charwich went there to look for him, while his partner searched Morrowind.  They planned to communicate their findings by letters sent through couriers.\nCharwich's first letter stated that he had found information that Neithwyr had a mysterious patron named Baliasir, a fact he had learned at a cemetery with a gravestone of Neithwyr's sister Peryra and a lycanthropic caretaker.  Koniinge replied back that he could find nothing about Baliasir, but believed that Neithwyr had returned to High Rock with Peryra after getting the Star.  Charwich's last letter was a written on his deathbed, having sustained mortal wounds from his battle with Baliasir, who it seemed had been a mighty daedra lord.\nKoniinge grieved for his friend, and traveled the span of the Empire to Wayrest, to pay his call of condolences on Lady Moorling, the woman at whose house Charwich had been staying.  After making some inquiries, Koniinge learned that her ladyship had left the city, quite suddenly.  She had been entertaining a guest named Charwich, and it was understood that he had died, though no one ever saw the body.  Certainly no healers had been sent to her house on the 13th of Last Seed of last year.  And no one in Wayrest, just like no one in Tel Aruhn, had ever heard of Baliasir.\nPoor Koniinge was suddenly unsure of everything.  He retraced his late partner's path through Boriane and Grimtry Gardens, but found that the Neithwyr family crypt was elsewhere, in a small town in the barony of Dwynnen.  There was indeed a lycanthropic caretaker, fortunately in human form at the time.  When questioned (using the technique of strangulation, release, strangulation, release), he told Koniinge the story that he had told Charwich many months before.\nHadwaf and Peryra Neithwyr had returned to Dwynnen, intent on settling old business.  As the Star requires potent spirits for power, they thought they would begin small by capturing the spirit of the werewolf they knew of in the family graveyard.  Sadly, for them, their grasp exceeded their reach.  When the poor caretaker resumed his human form one morning, he found himself lying next to the shredded, bloody bodies of the Neithwyr siblings.  Distressed and fearful, he brought the corpses and all their possessions down into the crypt.   They were still there when Charwich came, and so too was Azura's Star.\nKoniinge now saw things clearly.  The letters he had received from Charwich were lies, intended to keep him away.  Undoubtedly with the assistance of Lady Moorling, his new partner, he had concocted stories, including one of his own demise, to trick Koniinge into abandoning the quest for the Star.  It was clearly a sad statement on the nature of friendship, and one that needed immediate correction.\nIt took the better part of six months for Koniinge to find his old partner.  Charwich and Lady Moorling had used the power of the Star to make themselves very wealthy and powerful.  They assumed a number of different identities in their travels through High Rock and Skyrim, and then down to Valenwood and the Summurset Isle.  Along the way, of course, the Star itself disappeared, as great daedric artifacts always do.  The couple still had much wealth, but their love sadly fell on troubled times.  When they reached Alinor, they parted ways.\nOne must assume that during their months together, Charwich must have told Lady Moorling about Koniinge.  It's pleasant to think of the loving couple laughing over the stories they were telling him about the mythical and dangerous Baliasir.  Charwich must not have given his former beloved a very accurate physical description, however, because when Lady Moorling (then under the identity of the Countess Zyliana) met Koniinge, she had no idea who he was.  It came as quite a surprise to her when he began strangling her and requesting information about her former paramour.\nBefore she died, she told Koniinge what Charwich's new name and title was, and where he was looking for a new palace.  She even told him about me.  Given all the twists and bends the last months' chase took him on, it was not difficult to find which palace Charwich was looking to buy, and what time his appointment was to view it.  Then he had merely to arrive early, dispose of me, and wait.\nThere our story must sadly end.  I look forward to seeing you soon.\nYours,\nSyrix Goinithi,\nFormer Estate Banker\nP.S.: Charwich -- Turn around now, or don't.  Your choice.  Your friend, Koniinge.\n"

Nils, she says, if your chaurus pie is so good, you should write down the recipe.\nWell, I ain't good with my letters and I got no talent for writing, but I thought why not give it a go? So this here's my first ever recipe that I wrote down and I hope you like it.\nFirst thing you'll need is some chaurus meat and that ain't easy to come by. Chauruses mostly live in caves, and as like as not they share them caves with other nasty things.\nIf you go hunting for chaurus meat to make some dinner with, make sure you don't end up as dinner yourself. Haha.\nAnyway, like I was saying, get yourself some good armor and a nice big sword, and if you've got some stout men who won't run off at the first sign of trouble - in other words, not like one of them poncy Bretons - then go looking in caves and you'll find a chaurus sooner or later.\nThey look like big bugs the size of really big dogs, and mind you watch out for that acid they spit. That'll ruin your armor pretty quick.\nNow once you got some chaurus meat, you got to put it on a spit. Make sure you get that white, thick meat from the midsection. Don't use that yellow meat from the head or legs, because that's got poisonous acid in it and if you eat it, you'll probably die.\nSo you cook up your chaurus on the spit. And you want to baste it with sauce. To make that, grind up some tomatoes into pulp and then mix that with water, peppers, honey and salt. And then you have to boil it all together.\nI wouldn't use too many peppers, but you want a few spoons of salt. How much honey you use is up to you. Depends on how sweet you want it.\nWhen the chaurus is done and you've basted it enough, then you want to bake it in a pie with some potatoes, carrots and apples. And put the rest of that sauce you made in there, too.\nIf you want turnips, sometimes those are good. Depends on what you're in the mood for.\nThen you cook that for awhile. Look for the top to be light brown, that's when you know it's done.\nAnd that's it. Easy as pie. Haha."

    "text": "Children of the All-Maker\nby\n\tTharstan of Solitude\nIf the title of this text rings familiar, then perhaps you, like me, have had the great pleasure to become acquainted with a most remarkable people, the Skaal of Solstheim.\nUpon first meeting these gentle wild-folk, I was immediately impressed with their great hospitality. They welcomed me into their homes, one and all, without the slightest hint of suspicion or uncertainty. Trust, it seems, comes readily to the Skaal.\nIn appearance, the Skaal are clearly of Nord ancestry. However, they are culturally distinct in several significant ways, the most notable of which is their faith. Having never adopted the pantheon of the Empire, the Skaal recognize only a single deity whom they call the All-Maker.\nFor the Skaal, the All-Maker is the source of all life and creation. When a creature dies, its spirit returns to the All-Maker, who shapes it into something new and returns it to Mundus. The concept of death as an ending to life is unknown to the Skaal. Rather, death is seen as simply the beginning of the next stage of an endless journey.\nThis great respect for life is evident in one of the most important Skaal beliefs, a concept the villagers call \"one-ness with the land\". The Skaal try to live in harmony with their surroundings, making as small an impact on their environment as possible. When a Skaal villager sets out to collect firewood, for example, he or she takes it from fallen, dead trees. When the Skaal hunt, it is only out of necessity, and not for sport. Because they hold all life in great reverence, the Skaal people will resort to violence only as a last resort.\nThis has understandably led to a rather austere lifestyle for these simple, good-natured folk. For the Skaal, the word \"luxury\" is nearly an alien concept, though I was intrigued to note that one villager, Edla, has taken to trading basic goods with travelers who pass through the village in exchange for small luxury items. Such an enterprising outlook is something of a novelty for the Skaal.\nThough it saddens me to conclude this account on such a somber note, it is impossible to deny the hard truth that the Skaal people are dwindling. In a century or two, it is possible that their unique way of life will be lost to the world forever, reduced to little more than a footnote in the great epoch of history.\nThis comes as little surprise, given the immense hardships of a life lived in such an extreme environment. For the Skaal, it is a daily struggle to survive the perpetual wintry climate of northern Solstheim, but other challenges have recently appeared.\nThe ashfall from Vvardenfell has taken its toll on the plants and animals upon which the Skaal depend for their survival, and life is now a struggle for all who call Solstheim home.\nTherefore, I humbly beseech any students of history who might encounter this modest text to travel to Solstheim and learn all that can be learned of this noble people and their ancient customs. The Skaal people might not be long for this world, but let us assure that their proud and noble legacy lasts well into the future."

They see themselves as eternal outsiders and invaders, and even when they conquer and rule another people; they feel no kinship with them.\nThe breath and the voice are the vital essence of a Nord. When they defeat great enemies they take their tongues as trophies. These are woven into ropes and can hold speech like an enchantment. The power of a Nord can be articulated into a shout, like the kiai of an Akaviri swordsman. The strongest of their warriors are called \"Tongues.\" When the Nords attack a city, they take no siege engines or cavalry; the Tongues form in a wedge in front of the gatehouse, and draw in breath. When the leader lets it out in a kiai, the doors are blown in, and the axemen rush into the city. Shouts can be used to sharpen blades or to strike enemies. A common effect is the shout that knocks an enemy back, or the power of command. A strong Nord can instill bravery in men with his battle-cry, or stop a charging warrior with a roar. The greatest of the Nords can call to specific people over hundreds of miles, and can move by casting a shout, appearing where it lands.\nThe most powerful Nords cannot speak without causing destruction. They must go gagged, and communicate through a sign language and through scribing runes.\nThe further north you go into Skyrim, the more powerful and elemental the people become, and the less they require dwellings and shelters. Wind is fundamental to Skyrim and the Nords; those that live in the far wastes always carry a wind with them."

The Death of Lord Ihlendam\nIt happened in Second Planting (P.D. 1220) that Lord Ihlendam, on a journey in the Western Uplands, came to Nchuleft; and Protector Anchard and General Rkungthunch met him there, and Dalen-Zanchu also came to the meeting. They talked together long by themselves; but this only was known of their business, that they were to be friends of each other. They parted, and each went home to his own colony.\nBluthanch and her sons came to hear of this meeting, and saw in this secret meeting a treasonable plot against the Councils; and they often talked of this among themselves. When spring came, the Councils proclaimed, as usual, a Council Meet, in the halls of Bamz-Amschend. The people accordingly assembled, handfasted with ale and song, drinking bravely, and much and many things were talked over at the drink-table, and, among other things, were comparisons between different dwemer, and at last among the Councilors themselves.\nOne said that Lord Ihlendam excelled his fellow Councilors by far, and in every way. At this Councilor Bluthanch was very angry, and said that she was in no way less than Lord Ihlendam, and that she was eager to prove it. Instantly both parties were so inflamed that they challenged each other to battle, and ran to their arms. But some citizens who were less drunk, and more understanding, came between them, and quieted them; and each went back to his colony, but nobody expected that they would ever meet in peace again together.\nBut then, in the fall, Lord Ihlendam received a message from Councilor Bluthanch, inviting him to a parlay at Hendor-Stardumz. And all Ihlendam's kin and citizens strongly urged him not to come, fearing treachery, but Lord Ihlendam would not listen to counsel, not even to carrying with him his honor guard. And sadly, it came to pass that, while traveling to Hendor-Stardumz, in Chinzinch Pass, a host of foul creatures set upon Lord Ihlendam and killed him, and all of his party. And many citizens said thereafter that Bluthanch and her sons had conjured these beasts and set them upon Lord Ihlendam, but nothing was proven. Lord Ihlendam lies buried at a place called Leftunch."

So it did, for that same year issued forth a great concourse of devils from the ancient Elvish temple Malada, such had not been seen since the days of King Belharza. These devils greatly afflicted the land such that no man could plow, or reap, or seed, and the people appealed to the brothers of Marukh for succour. And then Abbot Cosmas gathered all the brothers and led them to Malada, also known as the High Fane in the Elvish tongue, and came against it with holy fire, and the foul demons were destroyed, and many devilish relics and books found therein were burned.

And because I hope that others who have also fallen into the sorry state of skooma addiction may therefore hear of my story, of how I fell into despair, and how I once again found myself and freed myself from my own self-imposed chains.\nBecause it is widely known to all Khajiit, who may be expected to know, that there is no cure for addiction to skooma, that once a slave to skooma, always a slave to skooma. Because this is widely known, it is taken to be true. But it is not true, and I am living proof.\nThere is no miracle cure. There is no potion to be taken. There is no magical incantation which frees you from the thrill of skooma running through your blood.\nBut it is through the understanding of that thrill, and the acceptance of the lust within oneself for that thrill, and the casting aside of the shame that the thrillseeker feels when he cannot set aside what becomes in the end his only comfort and pleasure, it is through this knowledge and understanding that the victim comes to the place where choices may be made, where despair and hope may be separated.\nIn short, only knowledge and acceptance can deliver into the slave's hands the key that opens his shackles and sets him free."

A quill and a candle.\nPerhaps the Jarl would like a confession. I would rather pass the time.\nWhen my father's harem burned down and our family fortune was lost to the ashes, my brother and I set to begging in the gutters of Elsweyr. I will never forget the first time we stole a traveler's purse. It was almost by accident. Just a slip of the claw and the pouch fell into our hands. We ate like kings that night. We slept in a warm bed for the first time in months.\nSoon after, my brother and I took up the knife. The gang we joined treated us as the dirty orphans we were. We robbed, we scammed, we cut and ran and years of debauchery and hard living took their toll. I lost half my left ear in a knife fight with a blind drunk Argonian.\nI wanted to give up, but my brother, he dreamed bigger, better.\nMy brother wanted to make it to Cyrodiil and become legit merchants. We had a plan. One final heist of a northbound caravan said to be filled with jewels.\nSomething went wrong. My brother could not stop the horses on time, and I stood helplessly by and watched the wagon plummet over a cliff. But as I picked through the wreckage, my devastation turned to excitement. There were no jewels, but there were plenty of luxurious wolf pelts, horker tusks and mammoth hides, more than enough to buy my way to Cyrodiil. I'd follow in the footsteps of so many of my kind. A traveling merchant, someone with a respectable profession.\nI had all the furs bundled in my pack when I saw my brother's broken body. His ears were still warm, and I shut his eyes for the last time. This was his dream. And he would want me to go. But what I wanted, well, the caravan guards were coming. I had to go, but I couldn't just leave his body to rot.\nMy brother gave me my first skin. It was to be a memento. But in the darkness of the fence's cabin, the coin hit my hand heavy. Then she looked at my brother's pelt and offered three times the amount of any other fur. Disgust caught in my throat, but did not live very long. I realized the cost of such a forbidden luxury. The value, the demand, the respect.\nThis is what I wanted.\nIt became easier. A dark alley, a gag in one hand and a quick slice across the throat. Gently hold the body as it bleeds. I became faster, my cuts precise and fluid. I peel the skin with one motion and kept the merchandise pristine, in one piece.\nI became rich. Far richer than anyone in my family had ever been. Yet I was careful. My stronghold was well-hidden, and practically impenetrable. I hired the men that used to employ me. We moved frequently on less traveled roads when we hunted in the wild. We stalked the back alleys we used to sleep in when we hunted in the city. I grew so rich that I no longer needed to dirty my own hands.\nPatchwork colored furs fetched the best price among the Bosmer. Argonians preferred the pelts completely skinned and tanned. Orcs prized the thick, waterproof leather of the Argonians. Humans most often bought tails and ears. I had to employ an alchemist and a master craftsman for a couple odd requests, but I didn't ask questions when the gold piled up.\nAnd now I'm a prisoner. Maybe I became careless. Maybe I let too many secrets slip between the sheets. The raid of my fortress was a massacre. They took me alive, barely. That was their mistake. My enemies should have killed me when they had the chance.\nI have one lockpick. And the northern wall of my cell is weak from disrepair. My head shall not roll tomorrow.\nI am not finished with the trade. There will always be buyers. Someday, I will sell my own skin for a king's ransom, as my name is legend. And yours shall rot in the gutters with your bones.\n-The Fur Trader\n"

    "text": "In Morrowind, both worshippers and sorcerers summon lesser Daedra and bound Daedra as servants and instruments.\nMost Daedric servants can be summoned by sorcerers only for very brief periods, within the most fragile and tenuous frameworks of command and binding. This fortunately limits their capacity for mischief, though in only a few minutes, most of these servants can do terrible harm to their summoners as well as their enemies.\nWorshippers may bind other Daedric servants to this plane through rituals and pacts. Such arrangements result in the Daedric servant remaining on this plane indefinitely -- or at least until their bodily manifestations on this plane are destroyed, precipitating their supernatural essences back to Oblivion. Whenever Daedra are encountered at Daedric ruins or in tombs, they are almost invariably long-term visitors to our plane.\nLikewise, lesser entities bound by their Daedra Lords into weapons and armor may be summoned for brief periods, or may persist indefinitely, so long as they are not destroyed and banished. The class of bound weapons and bound armors summoned by Temple followers and conjurors are examples of short-term bindings; Daedric artifacts like Mehrunes Razor and the Mask of Clavicus Vile are examples of long-term bindings.\nThe Tribunal Temple of Morrowind has incorporated the veneration of Daedra as lesser spirits subservient to the immortal Almsivi, the Triune godhead of Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and Vivec. These subordinate Daedra are divided into the Good Daedra and the Bad Daedra. The Good Daedra have willingly submitted to the authority of Almsivi; the Bad Daedra are rebels who defy Almsivi -- treacherous kin who are more often adversaries than allies.\nThe Good Daedra are Boethiah, Azura, and Mephala. The hunger is a powerful and violent lesser Daedra associated with Boethiah, Father of Plots -- a sinuous, long-limbed, long-tailed creature with a beast-skulled head, noted for its paralyzing touch and its ability to disintegrate weapons and armor. The winged twilight is a messenger of Azura, Goddess of Dusk and Dawn. Winged twilights resemble the feral harpies of the West, though the feminine aspects of the winged twilights are more ravishing, and their long, sharp, hooked tails are immeasurably more deadly. Spider Daedra are the servants of Mephala, taking the form of spider-humanoid centaurs, with a naked upper head, torso, and arms of human proportions, mounted on the eight legs and armored carapace of a giant spider. Unfortunately, these Daedra are so fierce and irrational that they cannot be trusted to heed the commands of the Spinner. As a consequence, few sorcerers are willing to either summon or bind such creatures in Morrowind.\nThe Bad Daedra are Mehrunes Dagon, Malacath, Sheogorath, and Molag Bal. Three lesser Daedra are associated with Mehrunes Dagon: the agile and pesky scamp, the ferocious and beast-like clannfear, and the noble and deadly dremora. The crocodile-headed humanoid Daedra called the daedroth is a servant of Molag Bal, while the giant but dim-witted ogrim is a servant of Malacath. Sheogorath's lesser Daedra, the golden saint, a half-clothed human female in appearance, is highly resistant to magic and a dangerous spellcaster.\nAnother type of lesser Daedra often encountered in Morrowind is the Atronach, or Elemental Daedra. Atronachs have no binding kinship or alignments with the Daedra Lords, serving one realm or another at whim, shifting sides according to seduction, compulsion, or opportunity."

    "text": "Deathbrand\n\tA Pirate's Tale\nHaknir Death-Brand was dying.\nFor Garuk Windrime, ship's quartermaster, it was unthinkable. His grandfather had served under Haknir, nigh on sixty years before, and even then he was a legend among the pirates of the north. \"The King of Ghosts,\" they called him, as eternal and pitiless as the sea he sailed. To Garuk, who had seen him charge into battle, clad in armor of gleaming Stalhrim like the kings of old, his twin swords scything men like grass, Haknir was practically a god.\nBut none feared Haknir more than his own crew. They knew his rages, his fits of madness, how he delighted in torture and murder for its own sake. And there were even darker rumors: Some said he fed upon the blood and souls of those he killed to extend his unnatural life. Some thought him a Daedra, loosed upon the mortal world. And others said he owed his life and power, his armor and swords, to a pact with Dagon, prince of destruction. And the seal of that pact was the terrible wound that scarred his face, never to heal - the Deathbrand, which no man could look upon without flinching.\nAll these things ran through Garuk's mind as he took his place on deck at the head of the crew, exchanging a curt nod with Thalin, the ship's helmsman and his chief rival. By sundown, he thought, one of them would be captain. The other would be dead.\nWhen Haknir finally emerged from his cabin, the crew fell silent. He looked frail, his voice raspy. But even so, he had a presence about him. As he looked over his men, the most brutal murderers ever to ply the northern seas, not one could meet his gaze. At last he sighed.\n\"You wish to know who will be my successor, and how my share of the treasure shall be divided.\"\nThat was the question, but even so, there were murmurs of protest. Haknir cut them off.\n\"All these years, I have looked for one who was worthy to take my place, or strong enough to take it from me. Not one of you even comes close. And so none of you shall have it.\"\nHe extended his hand. \"In Dagon's name, I place a curse upon my armor, and my swords. This ship, and all it carries. Until the day when one of you can best me in combat, you shall have not a single coin.\" He looked up at them. \"Be grateful I have left you with your lives.\"\nGaruk and Thalin shared a single glance. Had anyone else said such a thing, there would have been mutiny. A hundred treasure-mad pirates against one old man. But this was Haknir. The crew was silent.\nHaknir threw a map at Garuk's feet. \"Garuk, take a longboat, and bury my armor in the places I have marked. Thalin, we sail to my tomb, where you shall leave me with my gold. Then burn your ships, and do as you will. I am your captain no more.\" And with that, he turned and stalked back to his quarters.\nAt daybreak, Garuk took his leave, and set out in a longboat with three of his men. They landed on a shoal to the north of Solstheim, at the place Haknir had marked, made camp, and began to dig.\nBut already, greed stirred in Garuk's heart. Time and again, he glanced at the iron-bound chest they had brought with them. The old man was gone, perhaps already dead.

He placed the helmet on his head.\nAnd he screamed.\nAnd it is said you can hear that screaming still, on moonlit nights, on a rocky shoal off the northern coast of Solstheim.\nPostscript-\n\tThis story is one of the last in the \"Haknir Saga,\" the tales surrounding the life and adventures of the legendary pirate king Haknir Death-Brand.

    "text": "The Emperor's plans for the invasion of Akavir were laid in the 270s, when he began the conquest of the small island kingdoms that lie between Tamriel and Akavir. With the fall of Black Harbor in Esroniet in 282, Uriel V was already looking ahead to the ultimate prize. He immediately ordered extensive renovations to the port, which would serve as the marshalling point for the invasion force and as the main supply source throughout the campaign. At this time he also began the construction of the many large, ocean-going transports that would be needed for the final crossing to Akavir, in which the Navy was previously deficient. Thus it can be seen that the Emperor's preparations for the invasion were laid well in advance, before even the conquest of Esroniet was complete, and was not a sudden whim as some have charged.\nWhen Prince Bashomon yielded Esroniet to Imperial authority in 284, the Emperor's full attention could be devoted to planning for the Akaviri campaign. Naval expeditions were dispatched in 285 and 286 to scout the sea lanes and coastlands of Akavir; and various Imperial intelligence agents, both magical and mundane, were employed to gather information. On the basis of all this information, the kingdom of the Tsaesci, in the southwest of Akavir, was selected as the initial target for the invasion.\nMeanwhile the Emperor was gathering his Expeditionary Force. A new Far East Fleet was created for the campaign, which for a time dwarfed the rest of the Navy; it is said to be the most powerful fleet ever assembled in the history of Tamriel. The Fifth, Seventh, Tenth, and Fourteenth Legions were selected for the initial landing, with the Ninth and Seventeenth to follow as reinforcements once the beachhead was secured. While this may seem to the layman a relatively small fraction of the Army's total manpower, it must be remembered that this Expeditionary Force would have to be maintained at the end of a long and tenuous supply line; in addition, the Emperor and the Army command believed that the invasion would not be strongly opposed, at least at first. Perhaps most crucially, the Navy had only enough heavy transport capacity to move four legions at a time.\nIt should be noted here that the Commission does not find fault with the Emperor's preparations for the invasion. Based on the information available prior to the invasion, (which, while obviously deficient in hindsight, great effort had been made to accumulate), the Commission believes that the Emperor did not act recklessly or imprudently. Some have argued that the Expeditionary Force was too small. The Commission believes that on the contrary, even if shipping could have been found to transport and supply more legions (an impossibility without crippling the trade of the entire Empire), this would have merely added to the scale of the disaster; it would not have averted it. Neither could the rest of the Empire be denuded of legions; the memory of the Camoran Usurper was still fresh, and the Emperor believed (and this Commission agrees) that the security of the Empire precluded a larger concentration of military force outside of Tamriel. If anything, the Commission believes that the Expeditionary Force was too large. Despite the creation of two new legions during his reign (and the recreation of the Fifth), the loss of the Expeditionary Force left the Empire in a dangerously weak position relative to the provinces, as the current situation makes all too clear. This suggests that the invasion of Akavir was beyond the Empire's current strength; even if the Emperor could have fielded and maintained a larger force in Akavir, the Empire may have disintegrated behind him.\nThe Expeditionary Force left Black Harbor on 23rd Rain's Hand, 288, and with fair weather landed in Akavir after six weeks at sea. The landing site was a small Tsaesci port at the mouth of a large river, chosen for its proximity to Tamriel as well as its location in a fertile river valley, giving easy access to the interior as well as good foraging for the army. All went well at first. The Tsaesci had abandoned the town when the Expeditionary Force approached, so they took possession of it and renamed it Septimia, the first colony of the new Imperial Province of Akavir. While the engineers fortified the town and expanded the port facilities to serve the Far East Fleet, the Emperor marched inland with two legions. The surrounding land was reported to be rich, well-watered fields, and meeting no resistance the army took the next city upriver, also abandoned. This was refounded as Ionith, and the Emperor established his headquarters there, being much larger than Septimia and better-located to dominate the surrounding countryside.\nThe Expeditionary Force had yet to meet any real resistance, although the legions were constantly shadowed by mounted enemy patrols which prevented any but large scouting parties from leaving the main body of the army. One thing the Emperor sorely lacked was cavalry, due to the limited space on the transport fleet, although for the time being the battlemages made up for this with magical reconnaissance.\nThe Emperor now sent out envoys to try to contact the Tsaesci king or whoever ruled this land, but his messengers never returned. In retrospect, the Commission believes that valuable time was wasted in this effort while the army was stalled at Ionith, which could have been better spent in advancing quickly while the enemy was still, apparently, surprised by the invasion. However, the Emperor believed at the time that the Tsaesci could be overawed by the Empire's power and he might win a province by negotiation with no need for serious fighting.\nMeanwhile, the four legions were busy building a road between Septimia and Ionith, setting up fortified guard posts along the river, and fortifying both cities' defences, activities which would serve them well later. Due to their lack of cavalry, scouting was limited, and communication between the two cities constantly threatened by enemy raiders, with which the legions were still unable to come to grips.\nThe original plan had been to bring the two reinforcing legions across as soon as the initial landing had secured a port, but the fateful decision was now taken to delay their arrival and instead begin using the Fleet to transport colonists. The Emperor and the Council agreed that, due to the complete abandonment of the conquered area by its native population, colonists were needed to work the fields so that the Expeditionary Force would not have to rely entirely on the fleet for supplies. In addition, unrest had broken out in Yneslea, athwart the supply route to Akavir, and the Council believed the Ninth and Seventeenth legions would be better used in repacifying those territories and securing the Expeditionary Force's supply lines.\nThe civilian colonists and their supplies began arriving in Septimia in mid-Hearthfire, and they took over the preparation of the fields (which had been started by the legionnaires) for a spring crop. A number of cavalry mounts were also brought over at this time, and the raids on the two Imperial colonies subsequently fell off. Tsaesci emissaries also finally arrived in Ionith, purportedly to begin peace negotiations, and the Expeditionary Force settled in for what was expected to be a quiet winter.\nAt this time, the Council urged the Emperor to return to Tamriel with the Fleet, to deal with many pressing matters of the Empire while the army was in winter quarters, but the Emperor decided that it would be best to remain in Akavir. This turned out to be fortunate, because a large portion of the Fleet, including the Emperor's flagship, was destroyed by an early winter storm during the homeward voyage. The winter storm season of 288-289 was unusually prolonged and exceptionally severe, and prevented the Fleet from returning to Akavir as planned with additional supplies. This was reported to the Emperor via battlemage and it was agreed that the Expeditionary Force could survive on what supplies it had on hand until the spring.\nThe winter weather in Akavir was also much more severe than expected. Due to the supply problems and the addition of thousands of civilians, the Expeditionary Force was on tight rations. To make matters worse, the Tsaesci raiders returned in force and harried any foraging and scouting parties outside the walls of the two cities. Several watch forts on the road between Septimia and Ionith were captured during blizzards, and the rest had to be abandoned as untenable. As a result, communication between the two cities had to be conducted entirely by magical means, a continuing strain on the legions' battlemages.\nOn 5th Sun's Dawn, a large entourage of Tsaesci arrived at Ionith claiming to bring a peace offer from the Tsaesci king. That night, these treacherous envoys murdered the guards at one of the city gates and let in a strong party of their comrades who were waiting outside the city walls. Their clear intention was to assassinate the Emperor, foiled only by the vigilance and courage of troopers of the Tenth who were guarding his palace. Once the alarm was raised, the Tsaesci inside the city were hunted down and killed to the last man. Needless to say, this was the end of negotiations between the Emperor and the Tsaesci.\nThe arrival of spring only brought worse troubles. Instead of the expected spring rains, a hot dry wind began to blow from the east, continuing with varying strength through the entire summer. The crops failed, and even the river (which in the previous year had been navigable by small boats far upstream of Ionith) was completely dried up by Sun's Height. It is unknown if this was due to a previously unknown weather pattern unique to Akavir, or if the Tsaesci manipulated the weather through magical means. The Commission leans towards the former conclusion, as there is no direct evidence of the Tsaesci possessing such fearsome arcane power, but the latter possibility cannot be entirely ruled out.\nDue to prolonged bad weather, the supply fleet was late in setting out from Black Harbor. It finally left port in early Second Seed, but was again severely mauled by storms and limped into Septimia eight weeks later much reduced. Because of the increasingly desperate supply situation in Akavir, the Emperor dispatched most of his Battlemage Corps with the fleet to assist it in weathering the storms which seemed likely to continue all summer. At this time, the Council urged the Emperor to abandon the invasion and to return to Tamriel with the Expeditionary Force, but he again refused, noting that the fleet was no longer large enough to transport all four legions at once. The Commission agrees that leaving one or more legions behind in Akavir to await the return of the fleet would have damaged Army morale. But the Commission also notes that the loss of one legion would have been preferable to the loss of the entire Expeditionary Force. It is the unanimous opinion of the Commission that this was the last point at which complete disaster might have been averted. Once the decision was made to send the fleet back for reinforcements and supplies, events proceeded to their inevitable conclusion.\nFrom this point on, much less is known about what transpired in Akavir. With most of the battlemages assisting the fleet, communication between the Expeditionary Force and Tamriel was limited, especially as the situation in Akavir worsened and the remaining battlemages had their powers stretched to the limit attending to all the needs of the legions. However, it appears that the Tsaesci may also have been actively interfering with the mages in some unknown manner. Some of the mages in Akavir reported their powers being abnormally weak, and the mages of the War College in Cyrodiil (who were handling communications for the Council) reported problems linking up with their compatriots in Akavir, even between master and pupil of long training. The Commission urges that the War College make a particular study of the arcane powers of the Tsaesci, should the Empire ever come into conflict with Akavir again.\nWhat is known is that the Emperor marched out of Ionith in mid-Sun's Height, leaving only small garrisons to hold the cities. He had learned that the Tsaesci were massing their forces on the other side of a mountain range to the north, and he intended to smash their army before it could gather full strength and capture their supplies (of which he was in desperate need). This rapid advance seems to have taken the Tsaesci by surprise, and the Expeditionary Force crossed the mountains and fell on their camp, routing the Tsaesci army and capturing its leader (a noble of some kind). But the Emperor was soon forced to retreat, and the legions suffered heavily on their retreat to Ionith. The Emperor now found himself besieged in Ionith, cut off from the small garrison at Septimia which was also besieged. By this time, it seems that the efforts of the few remaining battlemages were devoted entirely to creating water to keep the army alive, a skill not normally emphasized at the War College. The fleet had arrived safely back to Black Harbor, thanks to the Battlemage Corps, but all attempts to return to Akavir were frustrated by a series of ever more savage storms that battered Esroniet throughout the rest of 289.\nThe Council's last contact with the Emperor was in early Frostfall. By Evening Star, the Council was extremely worried about the situation in Akavir and ordered the fleet to sail regardless of the risk. Despite the continued storms, the fleet managed to press on to Akavir. Hope was raised when contact was made with the Emperor's battlemage, who reported that Ionith still held out. Plans were quickly laid for the Expeditionary Force to break out of Ionith and fall back on Septimia, where the fleet would meet them. This was the last direct contact with the Expeditionary Force. The fleet arrived in Septimia to find its garrison under savage assault from a large Tsaesci army. The battlemages with the fleet threw back the enemy long enough for the survivors to embark and the fleet to withdraw.\nThe few survivors of the Expeditionary Force who reached Septimia told how the Emperor had led the army out of Ionith by night two days earlier, succesfully breaking through the enemy lines but then being surrounded by overwhelming forces on the road to Septimia. They told of a heroic last stand by the Emperor and the Tenth Legion, which allowed a remnant of the Fourteenth to reach Septimia. Two survivors of the Tenth arrived in Septimia that night, having slipped through the enemy lines during their undisciplined victory celebration. These men confirmed having seen the Emperor die, cut down by enemy arrows as he rallied the Tenth's shield wall.\nThe Commission believes that the invasion of Akavir was doomed from the start for several reasons, none of which could have been foreseen beforehand, unfortunately.\nDespite extensive intelligence-gathering, the Expeditionary Force was clearly unprepared for the situation in Akavir. The unexpected weather which plagued the army and navy was particularly disastrous. Without the loss of a majority of the Far East Fleet during the campaign, the Expeditionary Force could have been withdrawn in 289. The weather also forced the Emperor to assign most of his Battlemage Corps to the fleet, leaving him without their valuable assistance during the fighting which soon followed. And of course the unexpected drought which struck Ionith during 289 dashed the hopes of supplying the army locally, and left the Expeditionary Force in an untenable situation when besieged in Ionith.\nThe Tsaesci were also much stronger than intelligence reports had suggested. Information on the size of the army the Tsaesci were eventually able to field against the Expeditionary Force is vague, as the only serious fighting took place after regular communications were cut off between the Emperor and the Council. Nevertheless, it seems likely that the Tsaesci outnumbered the Emperor's forces by several times, as they were able to force four crack legions into retreat and then keep them under siege for several months.\nAs was stated previously, the Commission declines to criticize the initial decision to invade Akavir. Based on what was known at the time, the plan seemed sound. It is only with the benefit of hindsight does it become obvious that the invasion had very little chance of success. Nevertheless, the Commission believes several valuable lessons can be taken from this disaster.\nFirst, the Tsaesci may have extremely powerful arcane forces at their command. The possibility that they may have manipulated the weather across such a vast region seems incredible (and it should be noted that three Commissioners strongly objected to this paragraph even being included in this Report), but the Commission believes that this matter deserves urgent investigation. The potential danger is such that even the slight possibility must be taken seriously.\nSecond, the Tsaesci appear to possess no navy to speak of. The Expeditionary Force was never threatened by sea, and the Far East Fleet fought nothing but the weather. Indeed, initial plans called for a portion of the Fleet to remain in Akavir for use in coastal operations, but in the event there were very few places where the large vessels of the Fleet could approach the land, due to the innumerable reefs, sandbars, islands, etc. that infested the coastal waters north and south from Septimia. Due to the utter lack of trees in the plain around Septimia and Ionith, the Expeditionary Force was unable to build smaller vessels which could have navigated the shallow coastal waters. Any future military expeditions against Akavir would do well to consider some way of bringing a means for inshore naval operations in order to exploit this clear advantage over the Tsaesci, an advantage that was sadly unexploited by the Expeditionary Force.\nThird, much longer-term study needs to be made of Akavir before another invasion could even be contemplated. The information gathered over the four years prior to the invasion was extensive, but clearly inadequate. The weather conditions were completely unexpected; the Tsaesci much stronger than expected; and the attempted negotiations by the Emperor with the Tsaesci a disaster. Akavir proved alien beyond expectation, and the Commission believes any future attempt to invade Akavir should not be contemplated without much greater knowledge of the conditions, politics, and peoples of that continent than presently obtains.\nFinally, the Commission unanimously concludes that given what we now know, any attempt to invade Akavir is folly, at least in the present state of the Empire. The Empire's legions are needed at home. One day, a peaceful, united Empire will return to Akavir and exact severe retribution for the disaster at Ionith and for our fallen Emperor. But that day is not now, nor in the foreseeable future."

    "text": "Dragon.\nThe very word conjurs nightmare images of shadowed skies, hideous roaring, and endless fire. Indeed, the dragons were terrifying beasts that were once as numerous as they were deadly.\nBut what most Nords don't realize is that the dragons were in fact not simple, mindless beasts. Indeed, they were a thriving, intelligent culture, one bent on the elimination or enslavement of any non-dragon civilization in the entire world.\nIt therefore stands to reason that the dragons would require a way to communicate with one another. That they would need to speak. And through much research, scholars have determined that this is exactly what the dragons did. For the mighty roars of the beasts, even when those roars contained fire, or ice, or some other deadly magic, were actually much more - they were words. Words in an ancient, though decipherable, tongue.\nNonsense, you say? Sheer folly on the part of some overeager academics? I thought precisely the same thing. But then I started hearing rumors. The odd snippet of a conversation from some brave explorer or gold-coveting crypt diver. An always, always, it was the same word repeated:\nWall.\nSo I listened more. I began to arrange the pieces of the puzzle, and slowly unravel the mystery.\nSpread throughout Skyrim, in ancient dungeons, burial grounds, and other secluded places, there are walls. Black, ominous walls on which is written a script so old, so unknown, none who had encountered it could even begin its translation.\nIn my heart, I came to know the truth: this was proof of the ancient dragon language! For what else could it possibly be? It only made sense that these walls were constructed by the ancient Nords, Nords who had lived in the time of the dragons, and out of fear or respect, had somehow learned and used the language of the ancient beasts.\nBut at that point, all I had was my own gut instinct. What I needed was proof. Thus began the adventure of my life. One spanning 17 months and the deaths of three courageous guides and two sellsword protectors. But I choose not to dwell on those grim details, for the end result was so glorious, it made any hardship worth it.\nIn my travels, I found many of the ancient walls, and every suspicision proved true.\nIt did in fact appear as if the ancient Nords had copied the language of the dragons of old, for the characters of that language very much resemble claw marks, or scratches. One can almost envision a majestic dragon using his great, sharp talons to carve the symbols into the stone itself. And a human witness - possibly even a thrall or servant - learning, observering, so that he too could use the language for his own ends.\nFor as I observed the walls I found, I noticed something peculiar about some of the words. It was as if they pulsed with a kind of power, an unknown energy that, if unlocked, might be harnessed by the reader. That sounds like nonsense, I know, but if you had stood by these walls - seen their blackness, felt their power - you would understand that of which I speak.\nThankfully, although entranced, I was able to retain enough sense to actual transcribe the characters I saw. And, in doing so, I began to see patterns in the language - patterns that allowed me to decipher what it was I was reading.\nFor example, I transcribed the following passage:\n\n[Literal translation: HET NOK YNGNAVAR G1F KOD1V WO DR1 Y4 MORON AU FROD DO KROSIS NUZ SINON S3V DINOK 4RK DUK1N]\nAssigning those scratchings to actual Tamrielic langauge characters, I further translated what I saw into this:\nHet nok Yngnavar Gaaf-Kodaav, wo drey Yah moron au Frod do Krosis, nuz sinon siiv dinok ahrk dukaan.\nWhich translates into the Tamrielic as follows:\nHere lies Yngnavar Ghost-Bear, who did Seek glory on the Battlefield of Sorrows, but instead found death and dishonor.\nThen, in another crypt, I encountered a wall with this transcription:\n\n[Lit. Trans. HET NOK KOPR1N DO IGLIF 3Z SOS WO GRIND OK OBL1N NI KO MOROK2 VUK2N NUZ 4ST MUNAX H1LVUT DO L3V KRAS1R]\nWhich translates into:\nHet nok kopraan do Iglif Iiz-Sos, wo grind ok oblaan ni ko morokei vukein, nuz ahst munax haalvut do liiv krasaar.\nWhich ultimately translates into the Tamrielic as:\nHere lies the body of Iglif Ice-Blood, who met his end not in glorious combat, but at the cruel touch of the withering sickness.\nAnd there you see the pattern. The repeated words \"Here lies\" - which could only mean one thing: those walls marked actual ancient Nord burial grounds.\nYou can imagine my nearly uncontainable excitement. It all started to make sense. The anicent Nords used the dragon langauge for these walls for very specific reasons. One of them was obviously to mark the grave of some important figure. But what else? Were they all graves, or did they serve other purposes as well?\nI set off to find out, and was well rewarded for my efforts. Here is what I discovered.\nThis passage:\n\n[Lit. Trans. HET M4 T4ROD3S TAF3R SKORJI LUN SINAK WEN KLOV GOV9 N1L RINIK H4KUN ROK TOG1T W4 G4ROT]\nTranslates into this:\nHet mah tahrodiis tafiir Skorji Lun-Sinak, wen klov govey naal rinik hahkun rok togaat wah gahrot.\nWhich in Tamrielic translates into this:\nHere fell the treacherous thief Skorji Leech-Fingers, whose head was removed by the very axe he was attempting to steal.\nSo here we see a wall that marks the spot where some significant ancient Nord died.\nThis passage:\n\n[Lit. Trans. QETHSEGOL V4RUKIV D1NIK F4L3L K3R DO GRAV5N FROD, WO BOVUL KO M1R NOL KINZON Z4KR3 DO KRUZ3K HOKORON]\nTranslates into this:\nQethsegol vahrukiv daanik Fahliil kiir do Gravuun Frod, wo bovul ko Maar nol kinzon zahkrii do kruziik hokoron.\nWhich in Tamrielic translates into this:\nThis stone commemorates the doomed elf children of the Autumn Field, who fled in Terror from the sharp swords of the ancient enemy.\nThis wall seems to commemorate some ancient, long-forgotten event in Tamrielic history. Whether that event occurred on or near the place where the wall was erected, we will probably never know.\nAnd finally, this passage:\n\n[Lit. Trans. AESA W4L1N QETHSEGOL BR3N43 V4RUKT THOHILD FIN T8R WEN SMOL3N AG FRIN OL S4QO H2M]\nWhich translates into this:\nAesa wahlaan qethsegol briinahii vahrukt, Thohild fin Toor, wen smoliin ag frin ol Sahqo Heim.\nWhich in Tamrielic translates into this:\nAesa raised this stone for her sister, Thohild the Inferno, whose passion burned hot as the Red Forge.\nThis wall (and I encountered quite a few like this) was obviously commissioned or built by a specific person, to honor someone important to them. What was the significance of the location? Was it important to the person who died? Or is it the actual location of that person's death? Again, those answers are probably lost to time, and will never be know.\nAnd so you see, the ancient dragon language is, indeed, myth no more. It existed. But better yet, it still exists, and probably will until the end of time, thanks to the ancient Nords and their construction of these many \"word walls.\"\nBut don't take my word for it. For the walls are there for the discovering, in Skyrim's dangerous, secret places. They serve as a bridge between the realm of the ancient Nords, and our own. The dragons may never return to our world, but now we can return to theirs.\nAnd someday, someday, we may even unlock the strange, unknown power hidden in their words."

    "text": "The Lost Race of Tamriel, vol. I - Architecture and Designs\nDwarves\nThe Lost Race of Tamriel, Volume I\nArchitecture and Designs\nby \nCalcelmo\nScholar of Markarth\n\nLet me begin by correcting a common misconception. The proper term to use when referencing the ancient lost race of Tamriel is \"Dwemer.\" It is a word whose meaning is roughly translated to \"people of the deep\" in the common tongue, and whose use has been widely replaced by the more ubiquitous nomenclature, \"dwarves.\" I would like stated that I use the name \"dwarves\" in lieu of the more accurate term in these books out of sympathy for my readership, whom  I can safely assume does not have the breadth of scholarship that 200 years of study has given me.\nWith that small point finished, let us begin our discussion on the dwarves by focusing on the indisputable artifacts they have left behind: their architectural and cultural designs. Unlike the more controversial areas of dwarven scholarship, the construction of dwarven cities and relics are well-founded due to the plethora of samples taken from the ruins these peoples have left behind. My own home city, Markarth, was originally one such ruin, and I can state from first-hand experience that all dwarven designs share a set of common principles that we can use to determine true artifacts from fakes and delineate patterns and methodologies that were important to their craftsmen.\nFirst of all, we can say for certain that dwarven artisans favored stone, at least as far as their buildings were concerned. This is no surprise. With notable exceptions, the vast majority of dwarven architecture is found underground or carved out of mountains. It is possible, although only theoretically, that the dwarves first mastered masonry as a race quite early, and later examples of metalwork were added on to much earlier stone designs as the dwarves began to master more complex tools. Regardless, the foundation of all known dwarven ruins is built on stonework, and the structure of dwarven stonework is sharp, angular, and intensely mathematical in nature.\nBy a simple count, there are hundreds if not thousands of samples of dwarven buildings made of precise square shapes, and far fewer examples of discretely rounded or curved stonework, leading us to believe that early dwarves favored trusted, well-calculated designs based on angled lines rather than riskier, more imprecise calculations based on arcs and curves. This comparatively simple tradition of stonecutting has nevertheless resulted in buildings that are as structurally sound today as they were thousands of years ago, making the works of our most skilled masons today seem like child's play in comparison.\nMetalwork as far as we know is the primary method used to make almost all dwarven crafts. We cannot, however, discount more easily destructible materials such as clay, paper, and glass from outside the scope of dwarven craftsmanship, but given the tendency of dwarven design to favor the long-lasting over the fragile, we can safely assume that at the very least metal was a heavy preference. And the metal used in all so-far-discovered dwarven relics is entirely unique to their culture.\nNo other race has replicated whatever process was used to create dwarven metal. Although it can be easily mistaken for bronze -- and in fact many forgers of dwarven materials use bronze to create their fake replicas -- it is most definitely a distinct type of metal of its own. I have personally seen metallurgists attempt to combine several different types of steel and common and rare ores in order to imitate dwarven metal's exclusive properties, but the only method that has been successful is to melt down existing dwarven metallic scraps and start over from there.\nThe Lost Race of Tamriel, vol. II - Weapons, Armor and Machines\nDwarves\nThe Lost Race of Tamriel, Volume II\nWeapons, Armor and Machines\nby \nCalcelmo\nScholar of Markarth\n\nIn our previous discussion on the dwarves (or \"Dwemer\" in the more correct, scholarly terminology), we looked into the properties of dwarven architecture and metallic crafts. In this continuing discussion of Tamriel's Lost Race, we shall examine the ways in which dwarves waged war and kept out trespassers. Unlike many other cultures still existing today, the dwarves built and relied on increasingly complicated machines for a wide variety of martial tasks, and weapons and armor created solely for the purpose of being wielded by dwarven warriors show remarkably fewer points of progress beyond the basic designs.\nLet us begin by analyzing those basic weapons and armors. Anyone who has held a dwarven axe or worn a dwarven helmet can testify as to the ancient, ever-lasting quality of dwarven craftsmanship. Weapons do not deviate too greatly from their base function. Dwarven swords pierce through light armors with incredible effectiveness, owing primarily to the remarkable sharpness of tempered dwarven metal, and owing to a far lesser extent to its simple, double-edged design.\nCompare and contrast a sharp, angular dwarven dagger to a curved elven blade, and it becomes a small logical leap to say that dwarven weaponsmiths relied almost exclusively on creating quality materials first, and merely allowed the form of those materials to flow from the method that weapon was intended to kill people.\nAs a culture that built almost exclusively underground, it's no surprise that dwarven armors are built to withstand incredibly heavy blows. Again, the fact that they are also resistant to being pierced by arrows or small blades is more of a testament to superior dwarven metallurgy over superior dwarven armorsmithing, but it would be erroneous to thus conclude that dwarven smiths did not take the manufacture of their weapons and armor very seriously. Every piece of war crafts I have examined show a remarkable amount of unnecessary detailing and personalization that is just as evident today among the most ardent blacksmiths.\nA dwarven smith probably came from a long tradition that distinguished itself in way that, say, the grip of a mace would feel, or the design of the head of individual arrows. Although, due to the paltry lack of any cultural artifacts outside the weapons and armors themselves, this is only mere speculation.\nThe last, but probably most important discussion in this volume, pertains to the existence of dwarven machinery. Dwarves created and manufactured on a very broad scale thousands of mechanical apparatuses of varying complexity. The most simple of which is the standard \"arachnid\" design used to ward off trespassers. We are so far uncertain as to how the dwarves were able to bring to life these remarkably intelligent machines, but I have witnessed one stalk a highly trained thief for several hours, only to ambush him as he was dealing with a lock to some room or treasure trove -- I admit to have forgotten the details past the point at which it began spouting lightning at him.\nDwarven military machines also range from the human-sized \"Sphere\" warrior, which patrols the interiors of the ruins as a harmless ball only to emerge from it as a fully armed and armored automaton fighter, to the justly feared \"Centurion\" whose height ranges from twice to several hundred times human size depending on which reports you believe.\nThe Lost Race of Tamriel, vol. III - Culture and History\nDwarves\nThe Lost Race of Tamriel, Volume III\nCulture and History\nby \nCalcelmo\nScholar of Markarth\n\nIn this final volume on our discussion on the dwarves (again, see the term \"Dwemer\" for references using the more scholastic name), we will attempt an examination into the distinct culture and history of Tamriel's Lost Race. We must, however, begin such a discussion with a warning. Despite what certain academic circles would like people to believe, there is so far no evidence that verifies any claim as to the dwarves' particular customs, morals, myths, legends, laws, systems of governance, or involvement in major historical events outside of those few examples that remain indisputable.\nFor instance, while we can say with absolute certainty that the disappearance of the entire dwarven race happened very suddenly, only the laziest of junior scholars would say that this event happened in the same day or even the same hour. There is simply no proof to dispute the theory that perhaps the dwarves disappeared from Tamriel gradually over the course of several years or indeed several decades.\nThere is also nothing that disproves the source of this disappearance as being attributable to mass deaths, plagues, magical contamination, experiments into the nature of Aetherius gone wrong, or even race-wide teleportation into one of the planes of Oblivion. There is simply too little that the dwarves left behind that points to the nature of their great vanishing act, and this same frustration applies to all aspects of their social structure and history.\nWhat we know then can only be inferred by the writings of the other races which made contact with the dwarves before they left Tamriel. The dark elves (\"Dunmer\") for example teach that their great prophet Nerevar helped unite the dwarves and the elves in Morrowind against occupying Nord armies from Skyrim in the First Era, but Nord and Orc writings also indicate that the dwarves were also allied with them at various points and in various legendary battles of theirs.\nUnfortunately, none of these legends and folk lore make an effort to describe the dwarves in great detail, only that they were a secretive people and that an alliance with them was unusual enough to warrant crafting a story around. And past the First Era, no race makes note of encountering any living dwarves at all. This is further confounded by the fact that so many of the dark elven writings on their relationship with the dwarves were lost during the tragic eruptions of Vvardenfell during the Oblivion Crisis nearly 200 years ago. What secrets they could have revealed about the Lost Race are now buried behind layers of molten earth along with so many unfortunate dark elven people.\nThus, we conclude our discussion on the dwarves on a somber note. As with all scholarly endeavors, we are left with more questions than we have answers, and the proof we so desperately search for is so often out of reach, denied even to the most fervent effort.\nThe mysteries the dwarves have left us with could easily warrant another century or so worth of personal examination from me, and quite possibly even several millennia of excavation of even one dwarven ruin would be insufficient to paint a complete picture on them. But what we can see from our threadbare tapestry of dwarven artifacts is a careful, intelligent, industrious, and highly advanced culture whose secrets we as students and teachers of their works can only hope to uncover some day."

    "text": "Chapter 1\nMarobar Sul and the Trivialization\n\tof the Dwemer in Popular Culture\nby\n\tHasphat Antabolis\n\nWhile Marobar Sul's Ancient Tales of the Dwemer was definitively debunked in scholarly circles as early as the reign of Katariah I, it remains one of the staples of the literate middle-classes of the Empire, and has served to set the image of the Dwemer in the popular imagination for generations of schoolchildren. What about this lengthy (but curiously insubstantial) tome has proved so captivating to the public that it has been able to see off both the scorn of the literati and the scathing critiques of the scholars?\nBefore examing this question, a brief summary of the provenance and subsequent career of Ancient Tales would be appropriate. First published around 2E670, in the Interregnum between the fall of the First Cyrodilic Empire and the rise of Tiber Septim, it was originally presented as a serious, scholarly work based on research in the archives of the University of Gwylim, and in the chaos of that era was taken at face value (a sign of the sad state of Dwemer scholarship in those years). Little is known of the author, but Marobar Sul was most likely a pseudonym of Gor Felim, a prolific writer of \"penny dreadful romances\" of that era, who is known to have used many other pseudonyms. While most of Felim's other work has, thankfully, been lost to history, what little survives matches Ancient Tales in both language and tone (see Lomis, \"Textual Comparison of Gor Felim's A Hypothetical Treachery with Marobar Sul's Ancient Tales of the Dwemer\"). Felim lived in Cyrodiil his whole life, writing light entertainments for the elite of the old Imperial capital. Why he decided to turn his hand to the Dwemer is unknown, but it is clear that his \"research\" consisted of nothing more than collecting the peasants' tales of the Nibenay Valley and recasting them in Dwemer guise.\nThe book proved popular in Cyrodiil, and Felim continued to churn out more volumes until the series numbered seven in all. Ancient Tales of the Dwemer was thus firmly established as a local favorite in Cyrodiil (already in its 17th printing) when the historical forces that propelled Tiber Septim to prominence also began to spread the literature of the \"heartland\" across the continent. Marobar Sul's version of the Dwemer was seized upon in a surge of human racial nationalism that has not yet subsided.\nThe Dwemer appear in these tales as creatures of fable and light fantasy, but in general they are \"just like us\". They come across as a bit eccentric, perhaps, but certainly there is nothing fearsome or dangerous about them. Compare these to the Dwemer of early Redguard legend: a mysterious, powerful race, capable of bending the very laws of nature to their will; vanished but perhaps not gone. Or the Dwemer portrayed in the most ancient Nord sagas: fearsome warriors, tainted by blasphemous religious practices, who used their profane mechanisms to drive the Nords from Morrowind. Marobar Sul's Dwemer were much more amenable to the spirit of the time, which saw humans as the pinnacle of creation and the other races as unenlightened barbarians or imperfect, lesser versions of humans eager for tutelage. Ancient Tales falls firmly in the latter camp, which does much to explain its enduring hold on the popular imagination. Marobar Sul's Dwemer are so much more comfortable, so much friendlier, so much more familiar, than the real Dwemer, whose truly mysterious nature we are only beginning to understand. The public prefers the light, trivial version of this vanished race. And from what I have learned in my years of studying the Dwemer, I have some sympathy for that preference. As the following essays will show, the Dwemer were, to our modern eyes, a remarkably unlikeable people in many ways."

    "description": "Describes the various grades of blindness and understanding granted by the Elder Scrolls to their readers.",
    "text": "It is widely known among scholars that the Elder Scrolls entail a certain hazard in their very reading. The mechanism of the effects has, at present, been largely unknown -- theories of hidden knowledge and divine retribution were the subject of idle speculation with little investigation.\nI, Justinius Poluhnius, have undertaken to thoroughly document the ailments afflicted by the Elder Scrolls on their readers, though a unified theory of how they manifest continues to elude me and remains a subject for future study.\nI have grouped the effects into four, finding that the avenue of experience depends largely upon the mind of the reader. If this is unclear, I hope that a proper dichotomy will lay it plain.\nGroup the First: The Naifs\nFor one who has received no training in the history or nature of the Elder Scrolls, the scroll itself is, effectively, inert. No prophecy can be scried nor knowledge obtained. While the scroll will not impart learning to the uninformed, nor will it afflict them in any adverse fashion. Visually, the scroll will appear to be awash in odd lettering and symbols. Those who know their astronomy often claim to recognize constellations in the patterns and connections, but such conjecture is impossible to further investigate since the very nature of this study necessitates unlearned subjects.\nGroup the Second: The Unguarded Intellects\nIt is this second group that realizes the greatest danger from attempting to read the scrolls. These are subjects who have an understanding of the nature of the Elder Scrolls and possess sufficient knowledge to actually read what is inscribed there. They have not, however, developed adequate discipline to stave off the mind-shattering effect of having a glimpse of infinity. These unfortunate souls are struck immediately, irrevocably, and completely blind. Such is the price for overreaching one's faculties. It bears mentioning, though, that with the blindness also comes a fragment of that hidden knowledge -- whether the future, the past, or the deep natures of being is dependent on the individual and their place in the greater spheres. But the knowledge does come.\nGroup the Third: Mediated Understanding\nAlone in Tamriel, it would appear that only the Cult of the Ancestor Moth has discovered the discipline to properly guard one's mind when reading the scrolls. Their novitiates must undergo the most rigorous mental cultivation, and they often spend a decade or more at the monastery before being allowed to read their first Elder Scroll. The monks say this is for the initiates' own protection, as they must have witnessed many Unguarded Intellects among their more eager ranks. With appropriate fortitude, these readers also receive blindness, though at a far lesser magnitude than the Unguarded. Their vision fogs slightly, but they retain shape, color, and enough acuity to continue to read mundane texts. The knowledge they gain from the scroll is also tempered somewhat -- it requires stages of meditation and reflection to fully appreciate and express what one saw.\nGroup the Fourth: Illuminated Understanding\nBetween the previous group and this one exists a continuum that has, at present, only been traversed by the monks of the Ancestor Moth. With continued readings the monks become gradually more and more blind, but receive greater and more detailed knowledge. As they spend their waking hours pondering the revelations, they also receive a further degree of mental fortitude. There is, for every monk, a day of Penultimate Reading, when the only knowledge the Elder Scroll imparts is that the monk's next reading shall be his last.\nFor each monk the Penultimate Reading comes at a different and unknowable time -- preliminary work has been done to predict the occurrence by charting the severity of an individual monk's blindness, but all who reach these later stages report that the increasing blindness seems to taper with increased readings. Some pose the notion that some other, unseen, sense is, in fact, continuing to diminish at this upper range, but I shall leave such postulations to philosophers.\nTo prepare for his Ultimate Reading, a monk typically withdraws to seclusion in order to reflect upon a lifetime of revelations and appoint his mind for reception of his last. Upon this final reading, he is forever blinded as sure as those Unguarded ones who raced to knowledge. The Illuminated one, though, has retained his understanding over a lifetime and typically possesses a more integral notion of what has been revealed to him.\nIt is hoped that this catalog will prove useful to those who wish to further our mortal understanding of the Elder Scrolls. The Moth priests remain aloof about these matters, taking the gradual debilitation that comes with reading as a point of pride. May this serve as a useful starting point for those hoping to take up such study.\n---- Dictated to Anstius Metchim, 4th of Last Seed in the 126th year of the Second Era"

    "text": "The Thieves Guild of Skyrim is something of an enigma. Within the last few decades, their order has gone from one of the largest, most influential criminal organizations in all of Tamriel to a small group of stragglers barely able to wreak havoc in their home city of Riften. Although evidence that could explain this rapid decline has never surfaced, speculation has run rampant.\nOne theory holds that the Guild suffered a loss - it's strongly believed that their Guild Master was slain by one of their own. This Guild Master, known only as \"Gallus,\" maintained strong ties with many of the influential families in Skyrim. When he perished, those bonds perished with him. Without these bonds, the Guild could no longer safely operate within Skyrim's holds.\nA second theory suggests that the Guild is experiencing some sort of mystical \"curse\" causing normal activities for its members to become exceedingly difficult. While there is no solid evidence to support this theory, the last two decades have seen an unusual rise in failed attempts by the Guild to execute highly lucrative heists. Reasons for the presence of this supposed curse is being attributed to everything from the aforementioned murder to divine interference.\nIn order to solve this mystery once and for all, I've spent the last two years infiltrating the Thieves Guild. Initially making contact with them in Riften proved difficult, as they're quite wary of outsiders, but through repeated efforts I was able to gain their confidence. It's my hope that once I've gained access to some of the Guild leadership, I can learn more about their decline and publish a second volume of my work.\nAlthough helping the Guild perform their petty crimes brands me as a criminal, I feel that it's a burden worth bearing. The mystery of the Thieves Guild's fall from power needs to be solved once and for all as a matter of record and as a footnote to Skyrim's history.\n"

    "description": "Chronicle of a battle between Falmer and Nords on Solstheim in the early 1st era.",
    "text": "An account of the Battle of the Moesring as transcribed by Lokheim, chronicler to the chieftain Ingjaldr White-Eye\nFrom whence he came we did not know, but into the battle he rode, on a brilliant steed of pallid white. Elf we called him, for Elf he was, yet unlike any other of his kind we had ever seen before that day. His spear and armor bore the radiant and terrible glow of unknown magicka, and so adorned this unknown rider seemed more wight than warrior.\nWhat troubled, nay, frightened us most at that moment was the call that rose from the Elven ranks. It was not fear, not wonder, but an unabashed and unbridled joy, the kind of felicity felt by a damned man who has been granted a second chance at life.  For at that time the Elves were as damned and near death as ever they had been during the great skirmishes of Solstheim. The Battle of the Moesring was to be the final stand between Nord and Elf on our fair island. Led by Ysgramor, we had driven the Elven scourge from Skyrim, and were intent on cleansing Solstheim of their kind as well.  Our warriors, armed with the finest axes and swords Nord craftsmen could forge, cut great swaths through the enemy ranks. The slopes of the Moesring ran red with Elf blood. Why, then, would our foe rejoice? Could one rider bring such hope to an army so hopeless?\nTo most of our kind, the meaning of the call was clear, but the words were but a litany of Elven chants and cries. There were some among us, however, the scholars and chroniclers, who knew well the words and shuddered at their significance.\n\"The Snow Prince is come! Doom is at hand!\"\nThere was then a great calm that overcame the Elves that still stood. Through their mass the Snow Prince did ride, and as a longboat slices the icy waters of the Fjalding he parted the ranks of his kin. The magnificent white horse slowed to a gallop, then a trot, and the unknown Elf rider moved to the front of the line at a slow, almost ghostlike pace.\nA Nord warrior sees much in a life of bloodshed and battle, and is rarely surprised by anything armed combat may bring. But few among us that day could have imagined the awe and uncertainty of a raging battlefield that all at once went motionless and silent. Such is the effect the Snow Prince had on us all. For when the joyous cries of the Elves had ended, there remained a quiet known only in the solitude of slumber. It was then our combined host, Elf and Nord alike, were joined in a terrible understanding -- victory or defeat mattered little that day on the slopes of the Moesring Mountains. The one truth we all shared was that death would come to many that day, victor and vanquished alike. The glorious Snow Prince, an Elf unlike any other, did come that day to bring death to our kind. And death he so brought.\nLike a sudden, violent snow squall that rends travelers blind and threatens to tear loose the very foundations of the sturdiest hall, the Snow Prince did sweep into our numbers. Indeed the ice and snow did begin to swirl and churn about the Elf, as if called upon to serve his bidding. The spinning of that gleaming spear whistled a dirge to all those who would stand in the way of the Snow Prince, and our mightiest fell before him that day. Ulfgi Anvil-Hand, Strom the White, Freida Oaken-Wand, Heimdall the Frenzied. All lay dead at the foot of the Moesring Mountains.\nFor the first time that day it seemed the tide of battle had actually turned. The Elves, spurred on by the deeds of the Snow Prince, rallied together for one last charge against our ranks. It was then, in a single instant, that the Battle of the Moesring came to a sudden and unexpected end.\nFinna, daughter of Jofrior, a lass of only twelve years and squire to her mother, watched as the Snow Prince cut down her only parent. In her rage and sorrow, Finna picked up Jofrior's sword and threw it savagely at her mother's killer. When the Elf's gleaming spear stopped its deadly dance, the battlefield fell silent, and all eyes turned to the Snow Prince. No one that day was more surprised than the Elf himself at the sight that greeted them all. For upon his great steed the Snow Prince still sat, the sword of Jofrior buried deeply in his breast. And then, he fell, from his horse, from the battle, from life. The Snow Prince lay dead, slain by a child.\nWith their savior defeated, the spirit of the remaining Elven warriors soon shattered.  Many fled, and those that remained on the battlefield were soon cut down by our broad Nord axes. When the day was done, all that remained was the carnage of the battlefield. And from that battlefield came a dim reminder of valor and skill, for the brilliant armor and spear of the Snow Prince still shined. Even in death, this mighty and unknown Elf filled us with awe.\nIt is common practice to burn the corpses of our fallen foes. This is as much a necessity as it is custom, for death brings with it disease and dread. Our chieftains wished to cleanse Solstheim of the Elven horde, in death as well as life. It was decided, however, that such was not to be the fate of the Snow Prince. One so mighty in war yet so loved by his kin deserved better. Even in death, even if an enemy of our people.\nAnd so we brought the body of the Snow Prince, wrapped in fine silks, to a freshly dug barrow. The gleaming armor and spear were presented on a pedestal of honor, and the tomb was arrayed with treasures worthy of royalty. All of the mighty chieftains agreed with this course, that the Elf should be so honored. His body would be preserved in the barrow for as long as the earth chose, but would not be offered the protection of our Stalhrim, which was reserved for Nord dead alone.\nSo ends this account of the Battle of the Moesring, and the fall of the magnificent Elven Snow Prince. May our gods honor him in death, and may we never meet his kind again in life."

    "description": "Another lesson imparted by the Great Sage (from the Feyfolken books) to his students.",
    "text": "\"It is time for you to leave your apprenticeship here,\" said the Great Sage to his students, Taksim and Vonguldak.\n\"So soon?\" cried Vonguldak, for it had been but a few years since the training began. \"Are we such poor pupils?\"\n\"We have learned much for you, master, but you have no more to teach us?\" Taksim asked. \"You have told us so many tales of great enchanters of the past. Can't we continue to learn until we have reached some level of their power?\"\n\"I have one last story for you,\" smiled the Great Sage.\nMany thousands of years ago, long before the Cyrodilic Dynasty of Reman and even longer before the Septim Dynasty ruled Tamriel, and before there was a Mages Guild, and when the land called Morrowind was known as Resdayn, and the land of Elsweyr was called Anequina and Pellitine, and the only law of the land was the cruel ways of the Alessian Doctrines of Marukh, there lived a hermetic enchanter named Dalak who had two apprentices, Uthrac and Loreth.\nUthrac and Loreth were remarkable students, both equally assiduous in their learning, the pride of their Master. Both excelled at the arts of the cauldron, mirror castings, the infusion of spiritas into mundus, and the weaving of air and fire. Dalak was very fond of his boys, and they of him.\nOn a springtide morn, Dalak received a message from another enchanter named Peothil, who lived deep in the forests of the Colovian heartland. You must remember that in the dark days of the First Era, mages were solitary practitioners with the only organized consortium being the Psijics of Artaeum. Away from that island, mages seldom saw one another and even more rarely corresponded. Thus, when Dalak received Peothil's letter, he gave it his great attention.\nPeothil was greatly aged, and he had found the peace of his isolation threatened by the Alessian Reform. He feared for his life, knowing that the fanatical priests and their warriors were close at hand. Dalak brought his students to him.\n\"It will be an arduous and perilous journey to the Colovian Estates, one that I would fear partaking even in my youth,\" Dalak said. \"My heart trembles to send you two forth to Peothil's cave, but I know that he is a great and benevolent enchanter, and his light must continue to burn in the heart of the continent if we are to survive these dark nights.\"\nUthrac and Loreth pled with their teacher not to order them to go to Peothil. It was not the priests and warriors of the Alessian Reform they feared, but they knew their Master was aged and infirm, and could not protect himself if the Reform moved further westward. Finally, he relented and allowed that one would stay with him, and the other would journey forth to the Colovian Estates. He would let them decide which of them would go.\nThe lads debated and discussed, fought and compromised, and at last elected to let fate make the choice. They threw lots, and Loreth came up short. He left early the next morning, miserable and filled with fear.\nFor a month and a day, he tramped through the forests into the midst of the Colovian Estates. Through some planning, some skill, and much assistance for sympathetic peasants, he managed to avoid the ever-tightening circle of the Alessian Reform by crossing through unclaimed mountain passes and hidden bogs. When at last he found the dark caverns where Dalak had told him to search for Peothil, it was still many hours before he could find the enchanter's lair.\nNo one appeared to be there. Loreth searched through the laboratory of ancient tomes, cauldrons and crystalline flutes, herbs kept alive by the glow of mystic circles, strange liquids and gasses caught in transparent membranes. At last, he found Peothil, or so he presumed. The desiccated shell on the floor of the study, clutching tools of enchantment, scarcely seemed human.\nLoreth decided that he could do nothing further for the mage, and began at once the journey back to his true master Dalak and his friend Uthrac. The armies of the Reform had moved quickly since he passed. After more than one close near encounter, the young enchanter realized that he was trapped on all sides. The only retreat that was possible was back in the caves of Peothil.\nThe first thing to be done, Loreth saw, was to find a means to keep the army from finding the laboratory. That, he found, was what Peothil himself had been trying to do, but by a simple error even an apprentice enchanter could recognize, he had only succeeded in destroying himself. Loreth was able to take what he had learned from Dalak and apply it to Peothil's enchantments, quite successfully. The laboratory was never found or even detected by the Reform.\nMuch time passed. In the 480th year of the First Era, the great Aiden Direnni won many battles against the Alessian horde, and many passages and routes that had once been closed were now open. Loreth, now no longer young, was able to return to Dalak.\nWhen at last he found his way to his Master's old hovel, he saw candles of mourning lit in all the trees surrounding. Even before he knocked on the door and met his old fellow student Uthrac, Loreth knew that Dalak had died.\n\"It was only a few months ago,\" said Uthrac, after embracing his friend. \"He talked of you every day of every year you were away. Somehow he knew that you had not preceded him to the world beyond. He told me that you would come back.\"\nThe gray-haired men sat before the fire and reminisced of the old days. The sad truth was that they both discovered how different they had become. Uthrac spoke of carrying on the Master's work, while Loreth described his new discoveries. They left one another that day, each shaking his head, destined to never see one another again.\nIn the years ahead, before they left the mortal world to join their great teacher Dalak, they both achieved their desires. Uthrac went on to become respected if minor enchanter in the service of Clan Direnni. Loreth took the skills he had learned on his own, and used them to fashion the Balac-thurm, the Staff of Chaos.\nMy boys, the lesson is you have to learn from a teacher to avoid those small but essential errors that claimed the life of such self-taught enchanters as Peothil. And yet, the only way to become truly great is to try all the possibilities on your own."

    "description": "Summaries of the Songs of King Wulfharth, which tell of his rise to, and fall from, power. Also includes the hidden songs about his involvement at Red Mountain.",
    "text": "\nShor's Tongue\nThe first song of King Wulfharth is ancient, circa 1E500. After the defeat of the Alessian army at Glenumbria Moors, where King Hoag Merkiller was slain, Wulfharth of Atmora was elected by the Pact of Chieftains. His thu'um was so powerful that he could not verbally swear into the office, and scribes were used to draw up his oaths. Immediately thereafter the scribes wrote down the first new law of his reign: a fiery reinstatement of the traditional Nordic pantheon. The Edicts were outlawed, their priests put to the stake, and their halls set ablaze. The shadow of King Borgas had ended for a span. For his zealotry, King Wulfharth was called Shor's Tongue, and Ysmir, Dragon of the North.\nKyne's Son\nThe second song of King Wulfharth glorifies his deeds in the eyes of the Old Gods. He fights the eastern Orcs and shouts their chief into Hell. He rebuilds the 418th step of High Hrothgar, which had been damaged by a dragon. When he swallowed a thundercloud to keep his army from catching cold, the Nords called him the Breath of Kyne.\nOld Knocker\nThe third song of King Wulfharth tells of his death. Orkey, an enemy god, had always tried to ruin the Nords, even in Atmora where he stole their years away. Seeing the strength of King Wulfharth, Orkey summoned the ghost of Alduin Time-Eater again. Nearly every Nord was eaten down to six years old. Boy Wulfharth pleaded to Shor, the dead Chieftain of the Gods, to help his people. Shor's own ghost then fought the Time-Eater on the spirit plane, as he did at the beginning of time, and he won, and Orkey's folk, the Orcs, were ruined. As Boy Wulfharth watched the battle in the sky he learned a new thu'um, What Happens When You Shake the Dragon Just So. He used this new magic to change his people back to normal. In his haste to save so many, though, he shook too many years out on himself. He grew older than the Greybeards, and died. The flames of his pyre were said to have reached the hearth of Kyne itself.\nThe Ash King\nThe fourth song of King Wulfharth tells of his rebirth. The Dwarves and Devils of the eastern kingdoms had started to fight again, and the Nords hoped they might reclaim their ancient holdings there because of it. They planned an attack, but then gave up, knowing that they had no strong King to lead them. Then in walked the Devil of Dagoth, who swore he came in peace. Moreover, he told the Nords a wondrous thing: he knew where the Heart of Shor was! Long ago the Chief of the Gods had been killed by Elven giants, and they ripped out Shor's Heart and used it as a standard to strike fear into the Nords. This worked until Ysgramor Shouted Some Sense and the Nords fought back again. Knowing that they were going to lose eventually, the Elven giants hid the Heart of Shor so that the Nords might never have their God back. But here was the Devil of Dagoth with good news! The Dwarves and Devils of the eastern kingdom had his Heart, and this was the reason for their recent unrest. The Nords asked the Devil of Dagoth why he might betray his countrymer so, and he said that the Devils have betrayed each other since the beginning of time, and this was so, and so the Nords believed him. The Tongues sung Shor's ghost into the world again. Shor gathered an army as he did of old, and then he sucked in the long-strewn ashes of King Wulfharth and remade him, for he needed a good general. But the Devil of Dagoth petitioned to be that general, too, and he pointed out his role as the blessed harbinger of this holy war. So Shor had two generals, the Ash King and the Devil of Dagoth, and he marched on the eastern kingdoms with all the sons of Skyrim.\nRed Mountain\nThe fifth song of King Wulfharth is sad. The survivors of the disaster came back under a red sky. That year is called Sun's Death. The Devil of Dagoth had tricked the Nords, for the Heart of Shor was not in the eastern kingdoms, and had never been there at all. As soon as Shor's army had got to Red Mountain, all the Devils and Dwarves fell upon them. Their sorcerers lifted the mountain and threw it onto Shor, trapping him underneath Red Mountain until the end of time. They slaughtered the sons of Skyrim, but not before King Wulfharth killed King Dumalacath the Dwarf-Orc, and doomed his people. Then Vehk the Devil blasted the Ash King into Hell and it was over. Later, Kyne lifted the ashes of the ashes of Ysmir into the sky, saving him from Hell and showing her sons the color of blood when it is brought by betrayal. And the Nords will never trust another Devil again.\n\nThe Secret Song of\n\tWulfharth Ash-King\nThe Truth at Red Mountain\nThe Heart of Shor was in Resdayn, as Dagoth-Ur had promised. As Shor's army approached the westernmost bank of the Inner Sea, they stared across at Red Mountain, where the Dwemeri armies had gathered. News from the scouts reported that the Chimeri forces had just left Narsis, and that they were taking their time joining their cousins against the Nords. Dagoth-Ur said that the Tribunal had betrayed their King's trust, that they sent Dagoth-Ur to Lorkhan (for that is what they called Shor in Resdayn) so that the god might wreak vengeance on the Dwarves for their hubris; that Nerevar's peace with the Dwemer would be the ruin of the Velothi way. This was the reason for the slow muster, Dagoth-Ur said.\nThe Armies Grow\nAnd Lorkhan (for that is what they called Shor in Resdayn) said: \"I do not wreak vengeance on the Dwarves for the reasons that the Tribunal might believe I do. Nevertheless, it is true that they will die by my hand, and any whoever should side with them. This Nerevar is the son of Boethiah, one of the strongest Padomaics. He is a hero to his people despite his Tribunal, and he shall muster enough that this battle will be harder going still. We will need more than what we have.\" And so Dagoth-Ur, who wanted the Dwarves as dead as the Tribunal did, went to Kogoran and summoned his House chap'thil, his nix-hounds, his wizards, archers, his stolen men of brass. And the Ash King, Wulfharth, hoary Ysmir, went and made peace with the Orcs in spite of his Nordic blood, and they brought many warriors but no wizards at all. Many Nords could not bring themselves to ally with their traditional enemies, even in the face of Red Mountain. They were close to desertion. Then Wulfharth said: \"Don't you see where you really are? Don't you know who Shor really is? Don't you know what this war is?\" And they looked from the King to the God to the Devils and Orcs, and some knew, really knew, and they are the ones that stayed.\nThe Doom Drum\nNerevar carried Keening, a dagger made of the sound of the shadow of the moons. His champions were Dumac Dwarfking, who carried a hammer of divine mass, and Alandro Sul, who was the immortal son of Azura and wore the Wraith Mail. They met Lorkhan at the last battle of Red Mountain. Lorkhan had his Heart again, but he had long been from it, and he needed time. Wulfharth met Sul but could not strike him, and he fell from grievous wounds, but not before shouting Sul blind. Dagoth-Ur met Dumac and slew him, but not before Sunder struck his lord's Heart. Nerevar turned away from Lorkhan and struck down Dagoth-Ur in rage, but he took a mortal wound from Lorkhan in turn. But Nerevar feigned the death that was coming early and so struck Lorkhan with surprise on his side. The Heart had been made solid by Sunder's tuning blow and Keening could now cut it out. And it was cut out and Lorkhan was defeated and the whole ordeal was thought over."

    "text": "Dearest reader: The work you are about to experience has been copied and duplicated, so that the story it relates can be spread throughout the Empire. But make no mistake - this is not a work of fiction. The events chronicled in this account are all true, were originally documented in a private journal (which now remains safely guarded in the House of Quills in Hammerfell) and occurred not more than a year before this book was printed.\n- Ashad Ibn Khaled, High Scribe, House of Quills, Hammerfell\nIt's been nine days. Nine days since I slipped my bonds. Nine days since I strangled my captor with my own chains. And nine days since I rushed headlong into the night, always listening, but never looking back.\nBut in order to understand my current predicament, one must first understand where I came from, and just where this story began.\nMy name is Hadrik Oaken-Heart, and I am a proud Nord of Skyrim. I am a skald by trade, and received my formal training at the Bards College in Solitude. For years, I made my occupation as a traveling musician and minstrel, and even served several stints as war-bard in service to the armies of the various Jarls.\nAnd it's fairly safe to say that if I weren't a bard, I never would have gotten into this mess to begin with.\nMy troubles began when I first started singing about Talos, the Ninth and greatest Divine, beloved of the people of Skyrim. Turns out, he's not so beloved by the Thalmor.\nAh yes, the Thalmor. As common as a head cold in Skyrim these days, and just as annoying. Or so I thought at the time, before their true power and inlfuence made itself known.\nFor those not in the know, the Thalmor are Skyrim's recently honored \"guests\" - high elves of the Aldmeri Dominion who were gracious enough not to wipe us all out during the Great War.\nBut, as every Nord of Skyrim knows, Thalmor graciousness comes at a terrible price. One of the stipulations of the White-Gold Concordat - the peace treaty between our peoples - was the abolishment of Talos worship.  A man ascend to godhood? Preposterous, claim the Thalmor. And so, the open worship of Talos has been outlawed in Skyrim, and actively enforced in those cities where the Thalmor have a tangible presence. Cities, I might add, in which the Empire has the most secure foothold.\nIt was in one of these cities - Markarth, to be exact - where I made the conscious decision to defy the ban on Talos worship. And my defiance came in the form of - what else? - a song. For what bard who has spent time writing and rehearsing an original work can possible refrain from performing it? So perform it I did. Not once, not twice, but seven times. Once a day, for an entire week.\nNow here's something most of my kinsman are unaware of: not all Thalmor in Skyrim are equal in station, or purpose. In fact, there is one group in particular that operates secretly, in the shadows - watching and waiting for those Nords who break the law, and continue their worship of almighty Talos. These are the Justiciars, and it is their job to enforce this, the most terrible of conditions of the White-Gold Concordat.\nAnd so, I would have performed my song for an eighth time had I been given the opportunity. Sadly, I was not. For the Justiciars had been watching, had been waiting. Instead, I received a black sack over my head in the wee hours of the morning, a dreadfully uncomfortable wagon ride, and sinister promises that I would enjoy my \"new home,\" which I came to realize was some sort of secret Thalmor prison or detention camp. One I was certain I would never leave alive.\nIt was at that moment I realized I needed to make my escape. No matter what - even if I died in the attempt - I had to slip the grasp of my captors. Better that than rot in some godsforsaken Thalmor jail until the end of time.\nI finally got my chance when the wagon stopped, and we made camp for the night. One of my two Thalmor guards set off into the forest to hunt, leaving me alone with the other. And so, my account comes full circle.\nIt is now nine days later, and in that time, I have realized the true extent of my foolishness. I couldn't have sung the song just once? Or maybe twice? Or not at all? I couldn't have swallowed my stubborn Nord pride and realized just how much power and influence the Thalmor truly have over the Jarls?\nNo. I could not. So now I run. Like a hare from the hound, I run. Always moving, rarely resting, never sleeping.  But the Thalmor dog my every move. Where will I go? How will I escape their grasp? I honestly don't know.  The only thing I now understand for certain is this: if the agents of the Aldmeri Dominion cannot have your soul, then they will take your very life.\nMy name is Hadrik Oaken-Heart, and I am a proud Nord of Skyrim. Remember me. For soon I will be dead."

    "text": "The Isle of Artaeum (ar-TAY-um) is the third largest island in the Summurset archipelago, located south of the Moridunon village of Potansa and west of the mainland village of Runcibae.  It is best known for being home to the Psijic Order, perhaps the oldest monastic group in Tamriel.\nThe earliest written record of Psijics is from the 20th year of the First Era and tells the tale of the renowned Breton sage and author Voernet, traveling to the Isle of Artaeum to meet with Iachesis, the Ritemaster of the Psijics.\nEven then, the Psijics were the counsellors of kings and proponents of the \"Elder Way,\" taught to them by the original race that inhabited Tamriel.  The Elder Way is a philosophy of meditation and study said to bind the forces of nature to the individual will.  It differs from magicka in origin, but the effects are much the same.\nThat said, it is perhaps more than coincidence that the Isle of Artaeum literally vanished from the shores of Summurset at the beginning of the Second Era at about the time of the founding of the Mages Guild in Tamriel.  Various historians and scholars have published theories about this, but perhaps none but Iachesis and his own could shed light on the matter.\nFive hundred years passed and Artaeum returned.  The Psijics on the Isle consisted of persons, mostly Elves, who had disappeared and were presumed dead in the Second Era.  They could not or would not offer any explanation for Artaeum's whereabouts during that time, or the fate of Iachesis and the original council of Artaeum.\nCurrently, the Psijics are led by the Loremaster Celarus, who has presided over the Council of Artaeum for the last two hundred and fifty years.  The Council's influence in Tamrielan politics is tidal. The kings of Summurset, particularly those of Moridunon, have often sought the Psijics' opinion. Emperor Uriel V was much influenced by the Council in the early, most glorious parts of his reign, before his disastrous attack on Akavir. It has even been suggested that the fleet of King Orghum of Pyandonea was destroyed by a joint effort of Emperor Antiochus and the Psijic Order.  The last four emperors, Uriel VI, Morihatha, Pelagius IV, and Uriel VII, have been suspicious of the Psijics enough to refuse ambassadors from the Isle of Artaeum within the Imperial City.\nThe Isle of Artaeum is difficult to chart geographically.  It is said that it shifts continuously either at random or by decree of the Council.  Visitors to the island are so rare as to be almost unheard of.  Anyone desirous of a meeting with a Psijic may find contacts in Potansa and Runcibae as well as many of the kingdoms of Summurset.\nWere it more accessible, Artaeum would be a favored destination for travelers.  I have been to the Isle once and still dream of its idyllic orchards and clear pastures, its still and silent lagoons, its misty woodlands, and the unique Psijic architecture that seems to be as natural as its surroundings as well as wondrous in its own right.  The Ceporah Tower in particular I would study, for it is a relic from a civilization that predates the High Elves by several hundred years and is still used in certain rites by the Psijics.  Perhaps one day I might return.\n[Note:  The author is currently on the Isle of Artaeum by gracious consent of Master Sargenius of the Council of Artaeum.]"

    "text": "Frontier, Conquest\n\tand Accommodation:\n\tA Social History of Cyrodiil\nUniversity of Gwylim Press\n\t3E 344\nHistorians often portray the human settlement of Tamriel as a straightforward process of military expansion of the Nords of Skyrim. In fact, human settlers occupied nearly every corner of Tamriel before Skyrim was even founded. These so-called \"Nedic peoples\" include the proto-Cyrodilians, the ancestors of the Bretons, the aboriginals of Hammerfell, and perhaps a now-vanished Human population of Morrowind. Strictly speaking, the Nords are simply another of these Nedic peoples, the only one that failed to find a method of peaceful accommodation with the Elves who already occupied Tamriel.\nYsgramor was certainly not the first human settler in Tamriel. In fact, in \"fleeing civil war in Atmora,\" as the Song of Return states, Ysgramor was following a long tradition of migration from Atmora; Tamriel had served as a \"safety valve\" for Atmora for centuries before Ysgramor's arrival. Malcontents, dissidents, rebels, landless younger sons, all made the difficult crossing from Atmora to the \"New World\" of Tamriel. New archeological excavations date the earliest human settlements in Hammerfell, High Rock, and Cyrodiil at ME800-1000, centuries earlier than Ysgramor, even assuming that the twelve Nord \"kings\" prior to Harald were actual historical figures.\nThe Nedic peoples were a minority in a land of Elves, and had no choice but to live peacefully with the Elder Race. In High Rock, Hammerfell, Cyrodiil, and possibly Morrowind, they did just that, and the Nedic peoples flourished and expanded over the last centuries of the Merethic Era. Only in Skyrim did this accommodation break down, an event recorded in the Song of Return. Perhaps, being close to reinforcements from Atmora, the proto-Nords did not feel it necessary to submit to the authority of the Skyrim Elves. Indeed, the early Nord chronicles note that under King Harald, the first historical Nord ruler (1E 113-221), \"the Atmoran mercenaries returned to their homeland\" following the consolidation of Skyrim as a centralized kingdom. Whatever the case, the pattern was set -- in Skyrim, expansion would proceed militarily, with human settlement following the frontier of conquest, and the line between Human territory and Elven territory was relatively clear.\nBut beyond this \"zone of conflict,\" the other Nedic peoples continued to merge with their Elven neighbors. When the Nord armies of the First Empire finally entered High Rock and Cyrodiil, they found Bretons and proto-Cyrodiils already living there among the Elves. Indeed, the Nords found it difficult to distinguish between Elf and Breton, the two races had already intermingled to such a degree. The arrival of the Nord armies upset the balance of power between the Nedic peoples and the Elves. Although the Nords' expansion into High Rock and Cyrodiil was relatively brief (less than two centuries), the result was decisive; from then on, power in those regions shifted from the Elves to the Humans."

It was a violent and terrible gale, one of the very worst I have seen in all my long years. The winds howled like all the daedra of Oblivion, and the driving snow made us blind to the world.\nRi'saad called a halt and we staggered from the road, our hands held over our faces to ward off the stinging pellets of ice. We huddled together in the shelter of a copse of pines. There was no hope of raising our tents - the wind would tear them from our hands the moment we unpacked them.\nThey struck at the height of the storm. There were perhaps half a dozen of the creatures. It was difficult to say, as the blowing snow and howling wind overwhelmed our sight and our hearing.\nThey were roughly man-sized, but hunched over and ugly. For garments, they wore only rags and leathers. They were armed with daggers and swords or various kinds, no doubt scavenged from their previous victims.\nThey had no noses to speak of, only long slits for nostrils. Their ears were sharply pointed, suggesting a distant kinship with the elves. With their pallid skin and lifeless black eyes, they seemed like something out of a nightmare.\nBhisha saw them first, but too late to save herself. So loud was her death-cry, we heard it over the roaring winds. That cry saved us all.\nAlerted to the presence of our foes, the Khajiit drew their blades and formed a circle, facing outward. The white fiends were too few to surround us completely, and the Khajiit fended off each attack. After three of the snow-devils had fallen, the rest fell back and did not come at us again.\nThe storm abated and we arrived in Windhelm the next morning. I have taken up residence in Candlehearth Hall and I find I am quite comfortable behind the towering stone walls of the city.\nComfortable, at least until I go to sleep and visions of those awful creatures return to haunt my dreams."

After many hours of difficult travel through tangled hawthorn hells and limberlosts, I was suddenly struck dumb by the aspect of five pure white columns rising from a jade-green mound of vines to perfect V-shaped arches and graceful capitals towering above the verdant forest growth. This spectacle caused me to meditate on the lost glories of the past, and the melancholy fate of high civilizations now poking like splinter shards of bone from the green-grown tumulus of time-swept obscurity.\nWithin the forest tangle I discovered an entrance leading down into the central dome of a great underground edifice once dedicated to Magnus, the God of Sight, Light, and Insight. Dimly lit by the faded power of its magical pools, the shattered white walls of the enclosure shimmered with a cold blue light.\nThe marble benches of the central plaza faced out across the surrounding waters to tall columns and sharp arches supporting the high dome. From the central island, stately bridges spanned the still pools to narrow walkways behind the columns, with broad vaulted avenues and limpid canals leading away through ever-deeping gloom into darkness. Reflected in the pools were the tumbled columns, collapsed walls, and riotous root and vine growth thriving the dark half-light of the magical fountains.\nThe ancient Ayleids recognized not the four elements of modern natural philosophy -- earth, water, air, and fire -- but the four elements of High Elf religion -- earth, water, air, and light. The Ayleids considered fire to be but a weak and corrupt form of light, which Ayleid philosophers identified with primary magical principles. Thus their ancient subterranean temples and sanctuaries were lit by lamps, globes, pools, and fountains of purest magic.\nIt was by these ancient, faded, but still active magics that I knelt and contemplated the departed glories of the long-dead Ayelid architects. Gazing through the glass-smooth reflections of the surrounding pools, I could see, deep below, the slow pulse, the waxing and waning of the Welkynd stones.\nThe chiefest perils of these ruins to the explorer are the cunning and deadly mechanisms devised by the Ayleids to torment and confound those would invade their underground sanctuaries. What irony that after these many years, these devices should still stand vigilant against those who would admire the works of the Ayleids. For it is clear... these devices were crafted in vain. They did not secure the Ayleids against their true enemies, which were not the slaves who revolted and overthrew their cruel masters, nor the were they the savage beast peoples who learned the crafts of war and magic from their Ayleid masters. No, it was the arrogant pride of their achievements, their smug self-assurance that their empire would last forever, that doomed them to fail and fade into obscurity.\n"

    "description": "Lists historically important leaders of the Companions.",
    "text": "This history is recorded by Swyk the Long-Sighted, of the Circle of Jorrvaskr in the 3rd era. While I am not gifted with a sharp gift of words, I have learned the stories of the Companions before me, and set to record them that they might not be lost when I am. Hereafter is the list of notable Harbingers of the Companions, those who lead us through the darkness to glories in Sovngarde.\n\nNotes on the Harbinger: the Companions have never had a true leader since Ysgramor -- none have been mighty enough to corral the great hearts that beat within Jorrvaskr. While others like mages and thieves need the blessings of their hierarchy to know how to dress, we Companions are capable of leading our own destinies to glory. The Harbinger advises, resolves disputes, and helps to clarify when questions arise of the nature of honor. In the thousands of years the Companions have held at Jorrvaskr, there have been Harbingers both terrible and brilliant, those known for their arm, those for their hearts, and those for their minds. Here are listed some of the most gloried Harbingers, who inspire song and deed.\n\nYsgramor: the first Harbinger, the first Man, the bringer of Words, and the one who first bound the Companions to honor in that far off land of long ago. Better people have written of him, so I will not attempt to meet their words.\nJeek of the River: Captain of the Jorrvaskr during the Return, discoverer of the Skyforge, founder of Whiterun, and keeper of the original oath of the Companions, now lost to time. While other crews sought glory in conquest, his was the first to settle and serve as protector for the less war-gifted in the land as they came behind.\nMryfwiil the Withdrawn: Several hundred years after the death of Ysgramor, the Companions as we now know them were soldiers for hire, little better than mercenaries. Our services could be purchased for the fighting of wars, but the commitment to individual honor meant that often Shield-Brothers would be forced to face each other on the field of battle. The bonds of honor which bind the Companions threaten to break, until Mryfwiil, in his wisdom, decreed that we would no longer be party to any war or political conflict of any kind. Because of his steady hand, the Companions today are known as impartial arbiters of honor, in addition to their glories on the field of battle.\nCirroc the Lofty: The first Harbinger to not be of ancestral Atmoran blood. This was around the time that the Nords began to think of themselves as such, and there were great disputes about purity and the legacy of Ysgramor. Cirroc first came to Jorrvaskr as a servant, but the Redguard quickly proved his mettle when treated disrespectfully by one of the less honor-bound warriors of the time. Granted the stature of an honorary Companion after saving the life of Harbinger Tulvar the Unmentioned, he became known as the most capable of Shield-Brothers in the hall, with speed and cunning surpassing any of the old Atmoran stock. His time as Harbinger was short-lived, but it is said that his field knowledge of bladework continues to pass to every new Companion through their training.\nHenantier the Outsider: The first elven Harbinger. Like Cirroc before him, he was initially subject to ridicule when arriving at Jorrvaskr, for this was the time (near the closing of the first era) when elves were not permitted to be full Companions, and few were even allowed to see the inside of the hall. Henantier was humble in the daylight hours, performing any task asked of him. At night, he trained fiercely in the outside yard, allowing himself only minutes of sleep before resuming his servant duties the next day. So he toiled through several Harbingers, never resting, never complaining, and always keeping his mind and body sharp. Given his long life, he came to be trusted by the new Companions as the one who them learn the ways of honor.\nWhen one such pupil had aged into an old man and become Harbinger himself, Henantier was the one at his deathbed. With all Companions assembled, he named Henantier as his successor, saying \"even an elf can be born with the heart of a Nord sometimes.\" There were some number of Companions who laid down their weapons that day, but those who remained knew the truth of honor, and it is their legacy we continue to bear.\nMacke of the Piercing Eyes: A Harbinger known for her great beauty, but any who underestimated her on account of it would never make the mistake again. Was said to have once stared down half an opposing army, then slaughtered the remainder single-handedly. Her disappearance in her 8th year as Harbinger has never been explained, though many slanderous lies claim to make accountings for it.\nKyrnil Long-Nose: After the dark periods in the late second era, when a string of false and dishonorable Harbingers laid claim to Jorrvaskr, it was Kyrnil Long-Nose who gathered the true hearts of the Companions in the wilds and stormed Jorrvaskr itself, killing the usurpers and returning honor through blood, in the old ways. He began the tradition of trusted advisors called the Circle (after our great lord Ysgramor's council of captains) who would serve as examples to the younger, newer Companions.\nBy ensuring that the notions of honor can have an unbroken string of tradition, he steadied the course of the Companions and restored our destinies to that of Ysgramor's, pressing ever onwards to Sovngarde."

These creatures do not shun the icy climes of the north, for as their name implies, they are largely immune to the cold.\nWhen food is especially scarce, a spider will venture out to hunt prey in the wilderness. Usually, however, the eight-legged devils prefer to ambush those unfortunate creatures who venture into their caverns seeking shelter.\nThe easiest way to locate a nest of frostbite spiders is to search for their large webs. Just take care not to get caught in one, for these webs are strong enough to trap a full-grown man. Once any part of you touches the sticky threads, it's nearly impossible to get free without help.\nAlso, keep a watchful eye toward the ceiling. The frostbite spider is as stealthy as it is swift, and can drop down onto your head and have its fangs in your back before you can scream.\nAs long as you find the frostbite spider before it finds you, collecting the venom should be a simple matter. Because they rely on their webs to immobilize their prey, the creatures are not that difficult to kill in open combat. If you're inclined toward the arcane arts, don't bother with ice spells. Fire magic will serve you far better.\nWith that, I will say farewell and good hunting. Remember, any loot that you find in the spider's web is yours to keep.\nThe larger the hole, the larger the spider.\n"

    "text": "Herbane's Bestiary:\n\tDwarven Automatons\n\n9 Hearthfire\nThe Dwarves have been extinct for many an age, and perhaps for the best. To see men and women the size of large children, all with beards, would be a most disturbing sight. Still, whatever wrath the Dwarves brought from the gods that consumed an entire civilization surely must have been an awe-inspiring thing to witness.\nThe remnants of their civilization lie buried in the hearts of mountains, and scholars and thieves the world over descend on the skeletal remains of dwarven cities like vultures, to scrape clean the bones of the past, old knowledge waiting to be exhumed and treasures to be discovered. But many men lay murdered in those halls of the damned, because those dwarven ruins do not release their treasures without a fight.\nMy kin would tell the stories long ago, when I was just a child, about how adept the Dwarves were at building machines. They would say that before our time, dwarves harnessed the power of the earth, and wielded fire and hammers to reshape steel and bronze with a mechanical brilliance that breathed life into these now ancient constructs of metal and magic. In the dark halls and chambers amid the ceasless droning of grinding gears and venting steam, they lie in wait to confound or destroy would-be plunderers of the dwarven sanctums, as the grim watchmen of the last vestiges of culture from a dead race.\nI descended into the humid darkness of Mzulft. The slow hiss of steam, creaking of metal and the rattle of old gears powering an empty city would unnerve most men. I could hear things in the darkness, skittering across the floor just out of sight and as I stepped over the bodies of plunderers or scholars who had not made it far, I knew it was not rats wandering these halls.\nSmall mechanical spiders set upon me with rapid movements, and machines sprouted from the walls and uncurled from spheres into contraptions that rolled on top of gears for legs and crossbows for arms. I could not help but marvel at these single purpose machines built for the murder of men. My sword and my shield are my strength and I am undeterred by such things because I had heard of greater things that roam these depths, and indeed something else in these chambers stirred, and it echoed with massive weight. As it lumbered closer, its feet struck the ground as if walking on massive pistons and as it loomed out of darkness, I could see it clear for the first time, axe for one hand, hammer for the other, as tall as five men, made of dull bronze with a face molded in the image of its masters. A Steam Centurion. The stories were true, these were the guardians of the greatest dwarven treasures.\nWe fought, and the dwarves must truly be extinct because our battle was surely booming enough to wake the dead. It came at me with hammer and axe, inhuman strength and great fortitude, and a purpose of nothing but murder. I dodged as it crushed the stone around me with futile strikes and I thrust and slashed at it with my blade and took every opening afforded as we shook the halls with violence. I refuse to be undone by a machine.\nWhere the average man would be long dead, I stood over the husk of this dead automaton, its steam escaping like a final gasp. I could have taken the dwarven artifacts and metal but left them there for others, for I would not hex my journey with the possessions of dead men and maybe that is where countless others go wrong.\nI will continue to my journey across the lands, And perhaps one day Herebane will meet a worthy challenge, for I have yet to see what would make me tremble."

They say she fled into the Reach and never reappeared, and justly so because they say the devilry of her magic had grown stronger with each new day. Shortly after, a witch of half woman and half bird had been sighted deep in the mountains, and as the sightings increased the young women began to disappear.\nThis tale has brought me to the Reach, where this witch they call a Hagraven makes it home. With sword and shield at the ready, for I must see this creature and I must slay it.\n24 Sun's Dawn\nThe stomach of an average man would turn at the cruelty set before me- I first saw the thatch and bone, the human skulls, the dead goat heads mounted on pikes, filthy animal pelts, loose entrails, and feathers matted in blood. I had heard that Forsworn revere and protect these Hagravens, and all around were their small, crude trinkets and alters to these witches on which sat dull, empty soul gems. What vile creature would live where all things are dead?\nDeeper into the lair, I heard it first- an unsteady shuffling, followed by a heaving, unforgettable stench. I thrust the torch in front of me and waited for my eyes to adjust to the tunnel of darkness ahead of me. I saw the silhouette of what I thought to be a frail woman on an awkward gait, but the light of the torch revealed something else. This Hagraven was horrifying, almost human but more an abomination of woman and creature fused together, nothing more than a husk of humanity surrendered in exchange for possession of the powers of dark magic. This magic corrupted her greatly, and her dull, glass eyes stared with hate from the visage of an old crone sat atop the body of a contorted, misshapen human body adorned with black feathers. It bristled as it let out a piercing scream, and as a vivid red light began to form in the palm of its talons, it was all I could do to raise my shield in defense of magic most foul. I fought through devilry that seemed to snatch life from me, and the thought that this thing was once a woman seemed to play on my nerves.\nMost men would have crumbled, but I do not bend. The Hagraven is a most repulsive creature, and deserving of its fate and its claws that are my trophy will tell the story of Herebanes triumph. I have naught but to continue my travels and my conquests, for I have yet to see what would make me tremble."

Another traveler there told me to be cautious, that there are creatures who settle into the powder white of the snow with nary a clue to the careless, until it is too late. He went on and on, with wild gestures and fantastic tales of entire merchant expeditions being killed by the beasts. His stories frightened the other inn patrons, but I will not be turned by a coward's tale, I will see these for my own eyes, for those icy caves and snow capped peaks of the north are exactly the type of places that call to an adventurer like me. It did not take me long to find what I sought.\nThese Ice Wraiths are lucid, serpentine creatures of magic, as if conjured from the frozen tundra and glaciers of Skyrim itself. At one with an environment that makes them nearly invisible, these ethereal apparitions are the death of many Nords, if not by their sudden, unholy strike that casts their entire body through their target, then by the malady of Witbane, a curse of infection that dulls the intellect and makes the target even more the victim.\nAs deadly as they are, Ice Wraiths are simple minded in their determination, and combat is a straight forward affair and brute force and a sharp blade are enough to fell these savage creatures. Only the heartiest of men would hope to survive just one of these beasts, but I have slain two with general ease.\nIt's good that I've found I can make decent coin selling the Ice Wraith's teeth, as they are a prized ingredient in alchemical potions. That will continue to afford me the opportunity to search these lands for a challenge worthy of story, for I have yet to see what would make me tremble."

So much has happened to this tiny town in such a short amount of time, and so many lives have been affected by it, I felt it necessary to describe its rich history within these volumes. During my research, I lived in Raven Rock for almost three years, and I got to know many of my fellow Dunmer who call Raven Rock their home. I hope that my readers will appreciate the amount of fortitude and perseverance that it must take to endure life in such an inhospitable and untamed land.\nRaven Rock was founded in 3E 427 by the East Empire Company in response to the discovery of a rich ebony mine on the southern edge of the island of Solstheim. The construction of the town took several months, and the mine immediately started yielding ebony ore that the miner's shipped to Windhelm in Skyrim. By 3E 432, the town was home to over thirty people, all of whom depended on the mine for their livelihood. At this time, Raven Rock was almost exclusively inhabited by Imperials and a few Nords who were drawn to the mine's wealth.\nWhen the Oblivion Crisis arose in 3E 433, Raven Rock remained largely untouched by Mehrunes Dagon's forces and work continued as usual. The bulk of the Imperial Guard that was stationed in Raven Rock was recalled to Cyrodiil to fight the invading forces, but a few soldiers remained behind in order to protect the ebony mine from bandits. It's uncertain whether any Oblivion Gates ever opened on Solstheim, as there appears to be no record of such an event ever occurring there.\nIn the first year of the Fourth Era, after the destruction of Ald'ruhn, many of the Dunmer Great Houses sent out small groups of their own to seek places to reestablish themselves. House Redoran's group was led by Brara Morvayn who immediately struck out for Solstheim. After some quick negotiations with the East Empire Company (and some speculate quite a bit of coin changing hands), Brara's group was allowed to settle in Raven Rock where they quickly became a part of the mining colony's way of life. The Dunmer proved to be both hard-working and reliable when it came to working in the mines, impressing the East Empire Company and solidifying their relationship.\nAll was going quite well until that fateful day in 4E 5 when the Red Mountain suddenly erupted, sending a massive blast across the Sea of Ghosts that struck Solstheim with its full fury. Raven Rock was heavily damaged by this wave of force, which toppled several of its stone structures and obliterated many of the wooden ones. Ironically, the mine once again proved to be the town's saving grace, as most of the population of Raven Rock was working underground at the time, and was completely shielded from the blast. This event wasn't without cost, however. Raven Rock was heavily dependent on nearby Fort Frostmoth for its defense, but the eruption had almost completely wiped it from the face of Solstheim. The few soldiers that survived took residence in Raven Rock itself and attempted to set up a makeshift garrison there, but these scant few were hardly a match for potential threats to their town. With the East Empire Company's permission, Brara brought in some of House Redoran's elite \"Redoran Guard\" to fill the void. The guard proved to be an ideal replacement for the fallen Imperial soldiers and have been guarding the town ever since.\nHistory of Raven Rock, Vol. II\nThe History of Raven Rock\n\tVolume II\n\tby\n\tLyrin Telleno\nForward\nRaven Rock is one of the more interesting colonies of Morrowind of the last two centuries.

I hope that my readers will appreciate the amount of fortitude and perseverance that it must take to endure life in such an inhospitable and untamed land.\nAfter a few years, the relentless ash storms from the ever-erupting Red Mountain had transformed Solstheim's southern reaches into pure ash wastes reminiscent of those present on Vvardenfell itself. The storms would leave behind deep dunes of ash that made life exceedingly difficult in Raven Rock. In order to protect the town from these drifts, Brara Morvayn proposed that the East Empire Company construct a large wall of her own design to protect the east end of town. The company quickly agreed and provided the necessary funds. After almost a year, the construction was complete and the huge edifice was named \"The Bulwark.\" The wall proved to be extremely effective and allowed work to continue unabated in the mines.\nIn 4E 16, when Solstheim was passed into the hands of the Dunmer people, the East Empire Company was forced to relinquish Raven Rock's control to House Redoran. The Council quickly named Brara Morvayn as councilor of their new town, and allowed her to rule Solstheim as she saw fit. As a result of this changing of the guard, almost the entire Imperial population left Raven Rock and returned to Cyrodiil. Brara continued to welcome the Dunmer that elected to settle on Solstheim. Some chose to stay in Raven Rock to work in the mines, and other took to more familiar territory and began a nomadic lifestyle in the ash wastes.\nThe next few decades were the golden years for Raven Rock. Brara Morvayn was keeping the peace, the mines were still producing large quantities of ebony and the Dunmer that lived on the island were happy. After almost fifty years of prosperity, in 4E 65, Brara Morvayn finally succumbed to old age and passed away. She was interred in the family's ancestral tomb and her son, Lleril Morvayn, took her place. The people who had lived in Raven Rock during Brara's time as councilor were pleased to discover that Lleril shared his mother's notions of rulership. He was fair and compassionate, which kept the people on the island quite happy for many decades.\nHistory of Raven Rock, Vol. III\nThe History of Raven Rock\n\tVolume III\n\tby\n\tLyrin Telleno\n\nForward\nRaven Rock is one of the more interesting colonies of Morrowind of the last two centuries.

I hope that my readers will appreciate the amount of fortitude and perseverance that it must take to endure life in such an inhospitable and untamed land.\nAll was going well in Raven Rock until 4E 95, when an attempt on Lleril's life was made without warning. Fortunately, the attack was unsuccessful thanks to the prowess of the Redoran Guard. Under questioning by Captain Modyn Veleth, the assassin was revealed to be Vilur Ulen of House Hlaalu. House Hlaalu had been at odds with House Redoran for years following their removal from the Council of Great Houses. The Hlaalu believe that House Redoran was instrumental in this reorganization, and have held a grudge ever since. Their attempt on Lleril's life was meant to send a message to the Council that House Redoran was not as mighty as they purported to be and that they were truly vulnerable and weak. The Redoran Guard investigated futhur and discovered that Vilur had been organizing a coup in Raven Rock in an attempt to fully wrest control of the island from Lleril's grasp. Vilur and his conspirators were executed and the coup was quelled.\nSeveral recent events have served to solidify the Dunmer people's respect for Lleril Morvayn. In 4E 130, the Bulwark began to show its age and threatened to crumble.  The councilor elected to use the bulk of his personal fortune to have it repaired. In 4E 150, a small force of Argonians landed on Solstheim with the intent of wreaking havoc on the island, and Councillor Morvayn led the charge against them personally. And in 4E 170, when the ebony mine finally began to dry up, he drained the remainder of his coffers keeping the people fed.\nBy 4E 181, the mine's ebony veins were completely exhausted. Lleril ordered the mine to be shut down, and Raven Rock turned to hunting and fishing for its trade. A few Dunmer families departed Solstheim and returned to the mainland, but most stayed behind.\nAt present, Lleril Morvayn is still the ruler of Raven Rock. The Redoran Guard continues to maintain order within the town and the surrounding area, keeping Raven Rock's residents safe, and in line. If even so much as a rumor of dissent reaches Lleril's ears, he has it quashed immediately. He's well aware that there may be a few Hlaalu loyalists still present among her population that would like to see him dead. The future may appear bleak for Raven Rock, but the spirit of its inhabitants will never be broken."

The stories are varied, ranging from deadly attacks to a girl who claims she was saved from drowning.\nI have taken it upon myself to compile some of these for those who journey along the frozen coast.\nOur first tale is of a hunter named Gromm.  He claims that one night while turning in after a long day of trapping, he saw a great shadow cast on the wall of his tent.  Did he get the horker or did the horker get him?\nGromm was a great trapper working in the frozen tundra collecting fox pelts but as he was about to fall asleep one night, he heard some noises coming from outside of his tent.\nHis first instinct was to remain calm and see if the beast would pass, but after some threatening roars, Gromm slowly made for his axe.  The creature detected his movement and began to thrash around using its great tusks to shred the hunter's tent and knocking the hunter off balance.\nAs he stumbled Gromm was able to use a frost spell scroll but the ice magic seemed to have diminished effect on the horker.  That tidbit may be of use to someone out there.\nAfter recovering from the stagger, Gromm was able to steady himself and with a few great cleaves killed the horker.  Though his camp was in ruins, Gromm was lucky to walk away with only a slight goring to his left thigh.\nDrawing of Horker Tusks\nGromm's parting comment was that if you do encounter a horker, remain calm and remember that if you survive, the meat and tusks will fetch a nice bit of gold at market.\n"

    "text": "For three hundred years I have been a priestess of Azura, the Daedric Princess of Moonshadow, Mother of the Rose, and Queen of the Night Sky. Every Hogithum, which we celebrate on the 21st of First Seed, we summon her for guidance, as well as to offer things of worth and beauty to Her Majesty. She is a cruel but wise mistress. We do not invoke her on any Hogithum troubled by thunderstorms, for those nights belong to the Mad One, Sheogorath, even if they do coincide with the occasion. Azura at such times understands our caution.\nAzura's invocation is a very personal one. I have been priestess to three other Daedric Princes, but Azura values the quality of her worshippers, and the truth behind our adoration of her. When I was a Dark Elven maid of sixteen, I joined my grandmother's coven, worshippers of Molag Bal, the Schemer Princess. Blackmail, extortion, and bribery are as much the weapons of the Witches of Molag Bal as is dark magic. The Invocation of Molag Bal is held on the 20th of Evening Star, except during stormy weather. This ceremony is seldom missed, but Molag Bal often appears to her cultists in mortal guise on other dates. When my grandmother died in an attempt to poison the heir of Firewatch, I re-examined my faith in the cult.\nMy brother was a wizard of the cult of Boethiah-and from what he told me, the Dark Warrior was closer to my spirit than the treacherous Molag Bal. Boethiah is a Warrior Princess who acts more overtly than any other Daedroth. After years of skulking and scheming, it felt good to perform acts for a mistress which had direct, immediate consequences. Besides, I liked it that Boethiah was a Daedra of the Dark Elves. Our cult would summon her on the day we called the Gauntlet, the 2nd of Sun's Dusk. Bloody competitions would be held in her honor, and the duels and battles would continue until nine cultists were killed at the hands of other cultists. Boethiah cared little for her cultists-she only cared for our blood. I do think I saw her smile when I accidentally slew my brother in a sparring session. My horror, I think, greatly pleased her.\nI left the cult soon after that. Boethiah was too impersonal for me, too cold. I wanted a mistress of greater depth. For the next eighteen years of my life, I worshipped no one. Instead I read and researched. It was in an old and profane tome that I came upon the name of Nocturnal-Nocturnal the Night Mistress, Nocturnal the Unfathomable. As the book prescribed, I called to her on her holy day, the 3rd of Hearth Fire. At last I had found the personal mistress I had so long desired. I strove to understand her labyrinthine philosophy, the source of her mysterious pain. Everything about her was dark and shrouded, even the way she spoke and the acts she required of me. It took years for me to understand the simple fact that I could never understand Nocturnal. Her mystery was as essential to her as savagery was to Boethiah or treachery was to Molag Bal. To understand Nocturnal is to negate her, to pull back the curtains cloaking her realm of darkness. As much as I loved her, I recognized the futility of unraveling her enigmas. I turned instead to her sister, Azura.\nAzura is the only Daedra Princess I have ever worshipped who seems to care about her followers. Molag Bal wanted my mind, Boethiah wanted my arms, and Nocturnal perhaps my curiosity. Azura wants all of that, and our love above all. Not our abject slavering, but our honest and genuine caring in all its forms. It is important to her that our emotions be engaged in her worship. And our love must also be directed inward. If we love her and hate ourselves, she feels our pain. I will, for all time, have no other mistress."

    "text": "I've seen many a man rush headlong into battle only to have their life cut short in an instant. I've been a trainer of the warrior arts for many spans - cut from the cloth of a great lineage of knights, Blades and even a distant sellsword or two.\nIt's with this knowledge that I'll try to pen a brief treatise on the subtle art of war. Not mage fire, not archery or criminal throat-slitting. But war. Man on man with nothing but a fine bit of steel between them.\nThe first thing you'll need to learn is how to block. The best way not to get killed is not to let the other man hit you. Use a shield, use it well. Now, you'll get tired from this. You may even get a little hurt. But a blocked blow is much better than a landed one. Over time you'll get better, eventually shrugging off even the mightiest of hits.\nBut beware - your foes, if they're not base cur bandits, will know how to counter you. They'll hit you with everything they've got in, order to open you up, and keep on hitting. So watch for these powerful attacks. While it's still better to absorb the impact with a quarter inch of steel, it's best to try to just step out of the way.\nRemember, against spells your blocking is useless until you're trained. So get up on mages quickly and let them eat steel. Deserves them right for using a witch weapon.\nYou can also block without a shield as well - just cross that blow with your sword, though this isn't nearly as effective.  And if you decide you're fancy and want to wield two blades, you can't block at all, so don't even try. Without both hands on the hilt you just won't have the strength to counter blows.\nBut, with a weapon in each hand you are much more likely to take your opponent down quickly. The best defense, some say.\nTo wield the blade there are some fundamentals. Quick strikes are always good, but can be repelled, so watch for your opponent's own defensive postures. Wait for an opening, or create one with your own heavy attacks. Hammers hit hardest but are slow. Same with maces and all blunt weaponry. Axes are a nice middle ground, while swords are the quickest but won't stagger your opponent as efficiently with the hard hits.\nKeep an eye not to get too exhausted - always try to save a little of your strength to counter blows, or even run! Keep moving during a fight. Never let yourself get cornered or surrounded. Pick your threats - weak spellcasters that can hurt you quick are the first things I fell.\nThe shield is not only a defensive tool. Put your shoulder into it and bash your opponent. This sends them flying and opens them up for quick counter assaults. Even better, put extra weight into it and power bash your opponent. If they're small this will put them on their knees.\nBigger opponents cannot be staggered by heavy attacks. Only the power bash will really knock them around and create openings for you to exploit.\nSo again - block, counter, bash! Hit them when they're down! They'll show no mercy, so why should you? Battle is about the offense, about catching your foe early and never relenting. Keep moving, keep swinging. If you consider yourself overly powerful, pick up a two-handed weapon and see your foes fall before you like wheat stalks. They're slow and unwieldy, but they shatter bones and cleave flesh better than anything.\nThe graves are filled with many a mediocre swordsman. If you don't have the stomach for war, try a monk's work. But if you do travel the path of the warrior, learn the basics and keep your head firmly planted on your shoulders - or someone's bound to lob it off."

    "text": "A Short Life of\n\tUriel Septim VII\nby\n\tRufus Hayn\n3E 368-389: Strategist and Conciliator\nThe early decades of Emperor Uriel's life were marked by aggressive expansion and consolidation of Imperial influence throughout the empire, but especially in the East, in Morrowind and Black Marsh, where the Empire's power was limited, Imperial culture was weak, and native customs and traditions were strong and staunchly opposed to assimilation. During this period Uriel greatly benefitted from the arcane support and shrewd council of his close advisor, the Imperial Battlemage, Jagar Tharn.\nThe story of Uriel's marriage to the Princess Caula Voria is a less happy tale. Though she was a beautiful and charming woman, and greatly loved and admired by the people, the Empress was a deeply unpleasant, arrogant, ambitious, grasping woman. She snared Uriel Septim with her feminine wiles, but Uriel Septim thereafter soon regretted his mistake, and was repelled by her. They heartily detested one another, and went out of their ways to hurt one another. Their children were the victims of this unhappy marriage.\nWith his agile mind and vaunting ambition, Uriel soon outstripped his master in the balanced skills of threat and diplomacy. Uriel's success in co-opting House Hlaalu as an advance guard of Imperial culture and economic development in Morrowind is a noteworthy example. However, Uriel also grew in pride and self-assurance. Jagar Tharn fed Uriel's pride, and hiding behind the mask of an out-paced former master counselor, Tharn purchased the complete trust that led finally to Uriel's betrayal and imprisonment in Oblivion and Tharn's secret usurpation of the Imperial throne.\n3E 389-399: Betrayed and Imprisoned\nLittle is known of Uriel's experience while trapped in Oblivion. He says he remembers nothing but an endless sequence of waking and sleeping nightmares. He says he believed himself to be dreaming, and had no notion of passage of time. Publicly, he long claimed to have no memory of the dreams and nightmares of his imprisonment, but from time to time, during the interviews with the Emperor that form the basis of this biography, he would relate details of nightmares he had, and would describe them as similar to the nightmares he had when he was imprisoned in Oblivion. He seemed not so much unwilling as incapable of describing the experience.\nBut it is clear that the experience changed him. In 3E 389 he was a young man, full of pride, energy, and ambition. During the Restoration, after his rescue and return to the throne, he was an old man, grave, patient, and cautious. He also became conservative and pessimistic, where the policies of his early life were markedly bold, even rash. Uriel accounts for this change as a reaction to and revulsion for the early teachings and counsel of Jagar Tharn. However, Uriel's exile in Oblivion also clearly drained and wasted him in body and spirit, though his mind retained the shrewd cunning and flexibility of his youth.\nThe story of Tharn's magical impersonation of the emperor, the unmasking of Tharn's imposture by Queen Barenziah, and the roles played by King Eadwyre, Ria Silmane, and her Champion in assembling the Staff of Chaos, defeating the renegade Imperial Battlemage Jagar Tharn, and restoring Uriel to the throne, is treated at length in Stern Gamboge's excellent three-Volume BIOGRAPHY OF BARENZIAH. There is no reason to recount that narrative here. Summarized briefly, Jagar Tharn's neglect and mismanagement of Imperial affairs resulted in a steady decline in the Empire's economic prosperity, allowed many petty lords and kings to challenge the authority of the Empire, and permitted strong local rulers in the East and the West to indulge in open warfare over lands and sovereign rights.\n3E 399-415: Restoration, the Miracle of Peace, and Vvardenfell\nDuring the Restoration, Uriel Septim turned from the aggressive campaign of military intimidation and diplomatic accommodation of his earlier years, and relied instead on clandestine manipulation of affairs behind the scenes, primarily through the agencies of the various branches of the Blades. A complete assessment of the methods and objectives of this period must wait until after the Emperor's death, when the voluminous diaries archived at his country estate may be opened to the public, and when the Blades no longer need to maintain secrecy to protect the identities of its agents.\nTwo signal achievements of this period point to the efficacy of Uriel's subtle policies: the 'Miracle of Peace' (also popularly known as 'The Warp in the West') that transformed the Iliac Bay region from an ruly assortment of warring petty kingdoms into the well-ordered and peaceful modern counties of Hammerfell, Sentinel, Wayrest, and Orsinium, and the colonization of Vvardenfell, presided over by the skillful machinations of King Helseth of Morrowind and Lady Barenziah, the Queen-Mother, which brought Morrowind more closely into the sphere of Imperial influence.\n3E 415-430: The Golden Peace, King Helseth's Court, and the Nine in the East\n\tFollowing the 'Miracle of Peace' (best described in Per Vetersen's DAGGERFALL: A MODERN HISTORY), the Empire entered a period of peace and prosperity comparable to the early years of Uriel's reign. With the Imperial Heartland and West solidly integrated into the Empire, Uriel was able to turn his full attention to the East -- to Morrowind.\nExploiting conflicts at the heart of Morrowind's monolithic Tribunal religion and the long-established Great House system of government, and taking advantage of the terrible threat that the corrupted divine beings at the heart of the Tribunal religion presented to the growing colonies on Vvardenfell, Uriel worked through shadowy agents of the Blades and through the court of King Helseth in Mournhold to shift the center of political power in Morrowind from the Great House councils to Helseth's court, and took advantage of the collapse of the orthodox Tribunal cults to establish the Nine Divines as the dominant faiths in Hlaalu and Vvardenfell Districts.\nHasphat Anabolis's treatment of the establishment of the Nine in the East in his four-volume LIFE AND TIMES OF THE NEREVARINE is comprehensive; however, he fails to resolve the central mystery of this period -- how much did Uriel know about the prophecies of the Nerevarine, and how did he learn of their significance? The definitive resolution of this and other mysteries must await the future release of the Emperor's private papers, or a relenting of the Blades' strict policies of secrecy concerning their agents.\n"

    "text": "Lycanthropic Legends of Skyrim\n\nby\nLentulus Inventius\nOrder of the Horn\n\nI had heard the same rumors as everyone else -- that the province of Skyrim was awash in various forms of Lycanthropy. I had studied werewolves for some time, and was keen to see if these rumors of werebears were actually substantiated. I elected to pursue these studies in the warmer summer months in deference to my fragile constitution.\nOne quickly finds that common villagers are of practically no use in this land. Whereas in Cyrodiil, even the youngest child can tell you the true fauna that inhabit its environs, here I find alleged \"wise men\" recounting tales of unicorns and flying horses directly alongside their stories of werebears, so I don't put any stock in the rumors. They certainly have their traditions for warding off werebears (certain plants and ceremonies), but nobody can attest to even having seen one first-hand, much less possess any sort of artifact. Everyone has a cousin or a friend who saw one once, but when pressed, these stories fall apart.\nI don't wish to completely discount these stories, but I also must conclude that they may have spun out of some wild retelling of a particularly vicious, but mundane, bear. Legends can take a life of their own, particularly when there are grains of truth, as here we have the very real threat of werewolves. I worry that by spreading stories of a potentially false (or at least rare) beast, people may begin to discount the threat that real beasts pose. But if Skyrim's people choose to lead a backwards life, shrieking at shadows and clouds, I will not stop them.\nThe werewolves of this land are a curious sort. At least the legends of them. Given the Nord flair for bravado, I had expected to see werewolf pelts lining walls in the cities, werewolf heads on pikes, that sort of gaudy show. Instead, few people in civilized society ever mentioned them, and my questions were usually met with nervous stares.\nThinking that perhaps the common folk were simply more cowardly than I had been lead to believe by my Nordic acquaintances in Cyrodiil, I sought out those known for actual bravery. The supposedly fearless warrior band of Whiterun, the Companions, lost all color when I broached the subject, and asked me to leave. I had thought better of them, and was disappointed at how quickly brave men and women can be intimidated by stories.\nPressing into the wilderness, away from any sort of settlement, I would often find hunters, willing to recount stories of their kills. It was finally through one of them (a certain Karsten Hammer-Back) that I heard my first (and unfortunately only) verifiable stories of werewolves in the province, accompanied by pelts and claws to prove the killing. Just as I was thrilling to finding some actual evidence of the local beasts, he got a wild, conspiratorial look in his eyes and began spinning tales of some band of werewolf hunters and their exploits in hunting down the creatures. I left him to mop his drool and continued my journeys.\nIn the end, I regret that my trip to Skyrim did not prove more productive. If it is indeed true that their breeds of lycanthropes are distinct from and more powerful than our local ones, they could prove to be powerful allies in our conflict against the influx of werevultures in Valenwood. If they have grown as great and terrible as my friend Gaelian asserts, they could soon threaten the interior of Tamriel. When the summer next crests, I plan to travel there for a better accounting of the winged cretins, so that I may make more fitting report to the council.\n"

    "text": "The ancient Ayleids believed that Nirn was composed of four basic elements -- earth, water, air, and light -- and of these four elements, they believed the most sublime form of light was star light. The stars are our links to the plane of Aetherius, the source of all magical power, and therefore, light from the stars is the most potent and exalted of all magical powers.\nFrom time to time, fragments of Aetherius fall from the heavens. The people know these fragments as 'shooting stars', and from time to time, such Aetherial fragments are found on Nirn. The most common varieties are known as 'meteoric iron'; this metal is prized by armorers and enchanters for its properties in the forging of enchanted weapons and armors. This meteoric iron is also the primary component in 'Ayleid Wells,' ancient enchanted artifacts found throughout Cyrodiil.\nAnother, rarer form of Aetherial fragment is called 'meteroic glass'. It is from such fragments that other rare Ayleid enchanted artifacts are crafted -- Welkynd Stones and Varla Stones.\nAyleids Wells are scattered across Cyrodiil's landscape. Their siting is a mystery; they are not associated with any known Ayleid cities or settlements. It is presumed that, in some manner, they harvest magical power from starlight. It is also suggested, without evidence or support, that they are located at the meeting points of ancient lines of magical power; however, modern arcane arts have discovered no perceptible evidence of such lines of power.\nThose with magical talents can draw magicka from Ayleid wells to restore their own reservoirs of magical power. No ritual or arcane knowledge is necessary, suggesting that these wells were designed to serve persons not skilled in the magical arts. Once drained, the wells replenish again only at magical midnight. Once recharged, they appear to radiate magical power back into the sky, which prompts some to theorize they are also objects with religious or magical ritual significance -- perhaps a means of offering magic back to the heavens.\nWelkynd Stones [Aldmeris - \"sky stone,\" \"heaven stone\"; literally, \"sky child\"] are pieces of cut and enchanted meteoric glass which apparently act as storage devices for magical power. A magical talent can restore his reseroirs of magicka from such stones. Alas, the means of restoring power to these stones may have been lost with the Ayleids. Currently, these objects simply crumble to dust after they have been used.\nGreat Welkynd Stones are exceptionally large pieces of enchanted meteoric glass. Scholars believe that at the heart of each ancient Ayleid city, a Great Welkynd Stone was the source of the settlement's magical enchantments. It may be that these great stones were linked to the lesser stones, restoring and maintaining their power. In any case, research on these Great Welkynd Stones is impossible, since all the known Ayleid ruins have been looted of their great stones, and no examples of these great stones are known to survive.\nAnother rare enchanted item found in Ayleid ruins is called a Varla Stone [Aldmeris - \"star stone\"]. Varla Stones are remarkably powerful, enabling untrained users to restore magical energy to any number of enchanted items. Because of their great value and utility, these items are also extremely rare, but since they are small and easily concealed, diligent explorers may still occasionally come across them in any Ayelid ruin.\nAyleid Wells. Welkynd Stones. Varla Stones. Consider, then, these marvels of magical enchantment. Are we then to conclude that the Ayleids were a superior race and culture? Did they so exceed us in art and craft that they mock the feeble powers of Third Era Wizards?\nNever! The Ayleids were powerful, yes, and cunning, but they were neither good nor wise, and so they were struck down. Their works have passed from Nirn, save these rare and sparkling treasures. Their ancient cities are dark and empty, save for the grim revenants and restless spirits condemned forever to walk the halls, keeping their melancholy vigils over bones and dust.\n"

    "text": "Mixed Unit Tactics\nin the Five Years War\nVolume One\nBy\nCodus Callonus\nThe Legions could learn from the unconventional tactics used by the Khajiit in the Five Years War against Valenwood. I was stationed at the Sphinxmoth Legion Fort on the border near Dune and witnessed many of the northern skirmishes firsthand.\nThe war started with the so-called \"Slaughter of Torval.\" The Khajiit claim that the Bosmer invaded the city without provocation and killed over a thousand citizens before being driven off by reinforcements from a nearby jungle tribe. The Bosmer claim that the attack was in retaliation for Khajiti bandits who were attacking wood caravans headed for Valenwood.\nIn the spring of 3E 396 the war moved closer to Fort Sphinxmoth. I was posted on lookout and saw parts of the conflict. I later spoke with both Khajiit and Bosmer who fought in the battle, and it will serve as an excellent example of how the Khajiit used a mixture of ground and tree units to win the war.\nThe Khajiit began the fight in an unusual way by sending tree-cutting teams of Cathay-raht and the fearsome Senche-raht or \"Battlecats\" into the outskirts of Valenwood's forests. When word reached the Bosmer that trees were being felled (allegedly a crime in the strange Bosmeri religion), a unit of archers were dispatched from larger conflicts in the south. The Bosmer were thus goaded into splitting their forces into smaller groups.\nThe Bosmer archers took up positions in the remaining trees whose branches were now twenty or more feet apart, allowing some light into the forest floor. The Bosmer bent the remaining trees with their magics into small fortifications from which to fire their bows.\nWhen the tree-cutters arrived the next morning, a half dozen Khajiit fell to the Bosmer arrows in the first volley. After that the Khajiit took large wooden shields from the backs of the Senche-raht and made a crude shelter. The Khajiit, even the enormous Senche-raht, were able to hide between this shelter and one of the larger trees. When it became apparent that the Khajiit would not leave their shelter, some Bosmer chose to descend and engage the Khajiit sword-to-claw.\nWhen the Bosmer were nearly upon the shelter, one of the Khajiit began playing on a native instrument of plucked metal bars. This was a signal of some kind, and a small group of the man-like Ohmes and Ohmes-raht emerged from covered holes on the forest floor. Although outnumbered, they were attacking from behind by surprise and won the ground quickly.\nThe Bosmer archers in the trees would have still won the battle were they not having troubles of their own. A group of Dagi and Dagi-raht, two of the less common forms of Khajiit who live in the trees of the Tenmar forest, jumped from one tree to another under a magical cover of silence. They took up positions in the higher branches that could not hold a Bosmer's weight. When the signal came, they used their claws and either torches or spells of fire (accounts from the two survivors I spoke with vary on this point) to distract the archers while the battle on the ground took place. A few of the archers were able to flee, but most were killed.\nApparently the Dagi and Dagi-raht have more magical ability than is widely believed if they were able to keep themselves magically silenced for so long. One of the surviving Bosmer told me that he saw a few ordinary cats among the Dagi and even claimed that these ordinary cats are known as 'Alfiq' and that they were the spellcasters, but Bosmer are almost as unreliable as the Khajiit when it comes to the truth, and I cannot believe that a housecat can cast spells.\nAt the end of the day the Khajiit lost perhaps a half-dozen fighters out a force of no more than four dozen, while the Bosmer lost nearly an entire company of archers. The survivors were unable to report back before a second company of archers arrived and this strategy was repeated again, with similar results. Finally, a much larger force was sent and the Bosmer won that battle with the help of the native animals of Valenwood. That third skirmish and the Khajiti response I will discuss in the second volume of this series.\n"

    "text": "Akavir means \"Dragon Land\". Tamriel means \"Dawn's Beauty.\" Atmora means \"Elder Wood\". Only the Redguards know what Yokuda ever meant.\nAkavir is the kingdom of the beasts. No Men or Mer live in Akavir, though Men once did. These Men, however, were eaten long ago by the vampiric Serpent Folk of Tsaesci. Had they not been eaten, these Men would have eventually migrated to Tamriel. The Nords left Atmora for Tamriel. Before them, the Elves had abandoned Aldmeris for Tamriel. The Redguards destroyed Yokuda so they could make their journey. All Men and Mer know Tamriel is the nexus of creation, where the Last War will happen, where the Gods unmade Lorkhan and left their Adamantine Tower of secrets. Who knows what the Akaviri think of Tamriel, but ask yourself: why have they tried to invade it three times or more?\nThere are four major nations of Akavir: Kamal, Tsaesci, Tang Mo, and Ka Po' Tun. When they are not busy trying to invade Tamriel, they are fighting with each other.\nKamal is \"Snow Hell\". Demons live there, armies of them. Every summer they thaw out and invade Tang Mo, but the brave monkey-folk always drive them away. Once Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal, a king among demons, attempted to conquer Morrowind, but Almalexia and the Underking destroyed him at Red Mountain.\nTsaesci is \"Snake Palace\", once the strongest power in Akavir (before the Tiger-Dragon came). The serpent-folk ate all the Men of Akavir a long time ago, but still kind of look like them. They are tall, beautiful (if frightening), covered in golden scales, and immortal. They enslave the goblins of the surrounding isles, who provide labor and fresh blood. The holdings of Tsaesci are widespread. When natives of Tamriel think of the Akaviri they think of the Serpent-Folk, because one ruled the Cyrodilic Empire for four hundred years in the previous era. He was Potentate Versidue-Shaie, assassinated by the Morag Tong.\nTang Mo is the \"Thousand Monkey Isles\". There are many breeds of monkey-folk, and they are all kind, brave, and simple (and many are also very crazy). They can raise armies when they must, for all of the other Akaviri nations have, at one time or another, tried to enslave them. They cannot decide who they hate more, the Snakes or the Demons, but ask one, and he will probably say, \"Snakes\". Though once bitter enemies, the monkey-folk are now allies with the tiger-folk of Ka Po' Tun.\nKa Po' Tun is the \"Tiger-Dragon's Empire\". The cat-folk here are ruled by the divine Tosh Raka, the Tiger-Dragon. They are now a very great empire, stronger than Tsaesci (though not at sea). After the Serpent-Folk ate all the Men, they tried to eat all the Dragons. They managed to enslave the Red Dragons, but the black ones had fled to (then) Po Tun. A great war was raged, which left both the cats and the snakes weak, and the Dragons all dead. Since that time the cat-folk have tried to become the Dragons. Tosh Raka is the first to succeed. He is the largest Dragon in the world, orange and black, and he has very many new ideas.\n\"First,\" Tosh Raka says, \"is that we kill all the vampire snakes.\" Then the Tiger-Dragon Emperor wants to invade Tamriel."

    "text": "Mystery of Talara, part 1\nThe Mystery of Princess Talara\nPart I\nby \nMera Llykith\nThe year was 3E 405.  The occasion was the millennial celebration of the founding of the Breton Kingdom of Camlorn.  Every grand boulevard and narrow alley was strung with gold and purple banners, some plain, some marked with the heraldic symbols of the Royal Family or the various principalities and dukedoms which were vassals of the King.  Musicians played in the plazas great and small, and on every street corner was a new exotic entertainer: Redguard snake charmers, Khajiiti acrobats, magicians of genuine power and those whose flamboyant skill was equally impressive if largely illusion.\nThe sight that drew most of the male citizens of Camlorn was the March of Beauty.  A thousand comely young women, brightly and provocatively dressed, danced their way down the long, wide main street of the city, from the Temple of Sethiete to the Royal Palace.  The menfolk jostled one another and craned their necks, picking their favorites.  It was no secret that they were all prostitutes, and after the March and the Flower Festival that evening, they would be available for more intimate business.\nGyna attracted much of the attention with her tall, curvaceous figure barely covered by strips of silk and her curls of flaxen hair specked with flower petals.  In her late twenties, she wasn't the youngest of the prostitutes, but she was certainly one of the most desirable.  It was clear by her demeanor that she was used to the lascivious glances, though she was far from jaded at the sight of the city in splendor.  Compared to the squalid quarter of Daggerfall where she made her home, Camlorn at the height of celebration seemed so unreal.  And yet, what was even stranger was how, at the same time, familiar it all looked, though she had never been there before.\nThe King's daughter Lady Jyllia rode out of the palace gates, and immediately cursed her misfortune.  She had completely forgotten about the March of Beauty.  The streets were snarled, at a standstill.  It would take hours to wait for the March to pass, and she had promised her old nurse Ramke a visit in her house south of the city.  Jyllia thought for a moment, picturing in her mind the arrangement of streets in the city, and devised a shortcut to avoid the main street and the March.\nFor a few minutes she felt very clever as she wound her way through tight, curving side streets, but presently she came upon temporary structures, tents and theaters set up for the celebration, and had to improvise a new path.  In no time at all, she was lost in the city where she had lived all but five years of her life.\nPeering down an alley, she saw the main avenue crowded with the March of Beauty.  Hoping that it was the tale end, and desirous not to be lost again, Lady Jyllia guided her horse toward the festival.  She did not see the snake-charmer at the mouth of the alley, and when his pet hissed and spread its hood, her charge reared up in fear.\nThe women in the parade gasped and surged back at the sight, but Lady Jyllia quickly calmed her stallion down.  She looked abashed at the spectacle she had caused.\n\"My apologies, ladies,\" she said with a mock military salute.\n\"It's all right, madam,\" said a blonde in silk. \"We'll be out of your way in a moment.\"\nJyllia stared as the March passed her.  Looking at that whore had been like looking in a mirror.  The same age, and height, and hair, and eyes, and figure, almost exactly.  The woman looked back at her, and it seemed as if she was thinking the same thing.\nAnd so Gyna was.  The old witches who sometimes came in to Daggerfall had sometimes spoke of doppelgangers, spirits that assumed the guise of their victims and portended certain death.  Yet the experience had not frightened her: it seemed only one more strangely familiar aspect of the alien city.  Before the March had danced it way into the palace gates, she had all but forgotten the encounter.\nThe prostitutes crushed into the courtyard, as the King himself came to the balcony to greet them.  At his side was his chief bodyguard, a battlemage by the look of him.  As for the King himself, he was a handsome man of middle age, rather unremarkable, but Gyna was awed at the sight of him.  A dream, perhaps.  Yes, that was it: she could see him as she had dreamt of him, high above her as he was now, bending now to kiss her.  Not a one of lust as she had experienced before, but one of small fondness, a dutiful kiss.\n\"Dear ladies, you have filled the streets of the great capitol of Camlorn with your beauty,\" cried the King, forcing a silence on the giggling, murmuring assembly.  He smiled proudly.  His eyes met Gyna's and he stopped, shaken.  For an eternity, they stayed locked together before His Highness recovered and continued his speech.\nAfterwards, while the women were all en route back to their tents to change into their costumes for the evening, one of the older prostitutes approached Gyna: \"Did you see how the King looked at you?  If you're smart, you'll be the new royal mistress before this celebration ends.\"\n\"I've seen looks of hunger before, and that wasn't one of them,\" laughed Gyna. \"I'd wager he thought I was someone else, like that lady who tried to run us over with her horse.  She's probably his kin, and he thought she had dressed up like a courtesan and joined the March of Beauty.  Can you imagine the scandal?\"\nWhen they arrived at the tents, they were greeted by a stocky, well-dressed young man with a bald pate and a commanding presence of authority.  He introduced himself as Lord Strale, ambassador to the Emperor himself, and their chief patron.  It was Strale who had hired them, on the Emperor's behalf, as a gift to the King and the kingdom of Camlorn.\n\"The March of Beauty is but a precursor to the Flower Festival tonight,\" he said.  Unlike the King, he did not have to yell to be heard.  His voice was loud and precise in its natural modulations. \"I expect each of you to perform well, and justify the significant expense I've suffered bringing you all the way up here.  Now hurry, you must be dressed and in position on Cavilstyr Rock before the sun goes down.\"\nThe ambassador needn't have worried.  The women were all professionals, experts at getting dressed and undressed with none of the time-consuming measures less promiscuous females required.  His manservant Gnorbooth offered his assistance, but found he had little to do.  Their costumes were simplicity itself: soft, narrow sheets with a hole for their heads.  Not even a belt was required, so the gowns were open at the sides exposing the frame of their skin.\nSo it was long before the sun had set that the prostitutes turned dancers were at Cavilstyr Rock.  It was a great, wide promontory facing the sea, and for the occasion of the Festival of Flowers, a large circle of unlit torches and covered baskets had been arranged.  As early as they were, a crowd of spectators had already arrived.  The women gathered in the center of the circle and waited until it was time.\nGyna watched the crowd as it grew, and was not surprised when she saw the lady from the March approaching, hand-in-hand with a very old, very short white-haired woman.  The old woman was distracted, pointing out islands out at sea.  The blonde lady seemed nervous, unsure of what to say.  Gyna was used to dealing with uneasy clients, and spoke first.\n\"Good to see you again, madam.  I am Gyna of Daggerfall.\"\n\"I'm glad you bear me no ill will because of the whores, I mean horse,\" the lady laughed, somewhat relieved. \"I am Lady Jyllia Raze, daughter of the King.\"\n\"I always thought that daughters of kings were called princess,\" smiled Gyna.\n\"In Camlorn, only when they are heirs to the throne.  I have a younger brother from my father's new wife whom he favors,\" Jyllia replied.  She felt her head swim.  It was madness, speaking to a common prostitute, talking of family politics so intimately. \"Relative to that subject, I must ask you something very peculiar.  Have you ever heard of the Princess Talara?\"\nGyna thought a moment: \"The name sounds somewhat familiar.  Why would I have?\"\n\"I don't know.  It was a name I just thought you might recognize,\" sighed Lady Jyllia. \"Have you been to Camlorn before?\"\n\"If I did, it was when I was very young,\" said Gyna, and suddenly she felt it was her turn to be trusting.  Something about the Lady Jyllia's friendly and forthcoming manner touched her. \"To be honest, I don't remember anything at all of my childhood before I was nine or ten.  Perhaps I was here with my parents, whoever they were, when I was a little girl.  I tell you, I think perhaps I was.  I don't recall ever being here before, but everything I've seen, the city, you, the King himself, all seem ... like I've been here before, long ago.\"\nLady Jyllia gasped and took a step back.  She gripped the old woman, who had been looking out to sea and murmuring, by the hand.  The elderly creature looked to Jyllia, surprised, and then turned to Gyna.  Her ancient, half-blind eyes sparkled with recognition and she made a sound like a grunt of surprise.  Gyna also jumped.  If the King had seemed like something out of a half-forgotten dream, this woman was someone she knew.  As clear and yet indistinct as a guardian spirit.\n\"I apologize,\" stammered Lady Jyllia. \"This is my childhood nursemaid, Ramke.\"\n\"It's her!\" the old woman cried, wild-eyed.  She tried to run forward, arms outstretched, but Jyllia held her back.  Gyna felt strangely naked, and pulled her robe against her body.\n\"No, you're wrong,\" Lady Jyllia whispered to Ramke, holding the old woman tightly. \"The Princess Talara is dead, you know that.  I shouldn't have brought you here.  I'll take you back home.\" She turned back to Gyna, her eyes welling with tears. \"The entire royal family of Camlorn was assassinated over twenty years ago.  My father was Duke of Oloine, the King's brother, and so he inherited the crown.  I'm sorry to have bothered you.  Goodnight.\"\nGyna gazed after Lady Jyllia and the old nurse as they disappeared into the crowd, but she had little time to consider all she had heard.  The sun was setting, and it was time for the Flower Festival.  Twelve young men emerged from the darkness wearing only loincloths and masks, and lit the torches.  The moment the fire blazed, Gyna and all the rest of the dancers rushed to the baskets, pulling out blossoms and vines by the handful.\nAt first, the women danced with one another, sprinkling petals to the wind.  The crowd then joined in as the music swelled.  It was a mad, beautiful chaos.  Gyna leapt and swooned like a wild forest nymph.  Then, without warning, she felt rough hands grip her from behind and push her.\nShe was falling before she understood it.  The moment the realization hit, she was closer to the bottom of the hundred foot tall cliff than she was to the top.  She flailed out her arms and grasped at the cliff wall.  Her fingers raked against the stone and her flesh tore, but she found a grip and held it.  For a moment, she stayed there, breathing hard.  Then she began to scream.\nThe music and the festival were too loud up above: no one could hear her - she could scarcely hear herself.  Below her, the surf crashed.  Every bone in her body would snap if she fell.  She closed her eyes, and a vision came.  A man was standing below her, a King of great wisdom, great compassion, looking up, smiling.  A little girl, golden-haired, mischievous, her best friend and cousin, clung to the rock beside her.\n\"The secret to falling is making your body go limp.  And with luck, you won't get hurt,\" the girl said.  She nodded, remembering who she was. Eight years of darkness lifted.\nShe released her grip and let herself fall like a leaf into the water below.\n\nMystery of Talara, part 2\nThe Mystery of\nPrincess Talara\nPart II\nBy\nMera Llykith\nShe felt nothing, darkness enveloping her body and mind.  Pain surged through her leg and with that sensation, a great feeling of cold washed over her.  She opened her eyes and saw that she was drowning.\nHer left leg would not move at all, but using her right one and her arms, she pulled herself up toward the moons above.  It was long way through the swirling currents that wrenched back at her.  At last she broke the surface and sucked in the cold night air.  She was still close to the rocky shoreline of the capitol city of the kingdom of Camlorn, but the water had carried her quite a ways from the point where she fell at Cavilstyr Rock.\nNot fell, she thought, correcting herself.  She had been pushed.\nFurther down current, she allowed herself to drift.  There the steep cliff walls sloped lower until they were close to the water's edge.  The silhouette of a large house on the shore loomed ahead, and as she neared it, she could see smoke rising from the chimney and the flicker of firelight within.  The pain in her leg was great, but greater still was the chill of the water.  The thought of a warm hearth fire was all the motivation she needed to begin swimming again.\nAt the shore's edge, she tried to stand but found she couldn't.  Her tears mixed with the sea water as she began to crawl across the sand and rock.  The simple white sheet which had been her costume at the Flower Festival was tattered and felt like a weight of lead across her back.  Beyond the point of exhaustion, she fell forward and began to sob.\n\"Please!\" she cried. \"If you can hear me, please help!\"\nA moment later, the door to the house opened and a woman stepped out.  It was Ramke, the old lady she had met at the Flower Festival.  The one who had started and cried \"It's her!\" even before she herself knew who she was.  By contrast, when the old woman came to her, this time there was no glimmer of recognition in her eyes.\n\"By Sethiete, are you hurt?\" Ramke whispered, and helped her up, acting as her crutch. \"I've seen that gown before.  Were you one of the dancers at the Flower Festival tonight?  I was there with Lady Jyllia Raze, the daughter of the King.\"\n\"I know, she introduced us,\" she groaned. \"I called myself Gyna of Daggerfall?\"\n\"Of course, I knew you looked familiar somehow,\" the old woman chuckled, and led her hop by hop across the beach and into the front door. \"My memory isn't as good as it used to be.  Lets get you warm and have a look at that leg.\"\nRamke took Gyna's soaking rags and covered her with a blanket as she sat at the fire.  As the numbness of the chill water began to leave her, it cruelly abandoned her to the intense agony of her leg.  Until then, she had not dared to look at it.  When she did, she felt vomit rise at the sight of the deep gash, fish-white dead flesh, plump and swollen.  Thick arterial blood bubbled up, splashing on the floor in streams.\n\"Oh dear,\" said the old woman, returning to the fire. \"That must rather sting.  You're lucky that I still remember a little of the old healing spells.\"\nRamke seated herself on the floor and pressed her hands on either side of the wound.  Gyna felt a flare of pain, and then a cool soft pinching and prickle.  When she looked down, Ramke was slowly sliding her wrinkled hands towards one another.  At their approach, the lesion began to mend before her eyes, flesh binding and bruises fading.\n\"Sweet Kynareth,\" Gyna gasped. \"You've saved my life.\"\n\"Not only that, you won't have an ugly scar on your pretty leg,\" Ramke chuckled. \"I had to use that spell so many times when Lady Jyllia was little.  You know, I was her nursemaid.\"\n\"I know,\" Gyna smiled. \"But that was a long time ago, and you still remember the spell.\"\n\"Oh, when you're learning anything, even the School of Restoration, there's always a lot of study and mistakes, but once you're as old as I am, there's no longer any need to remember things.  You just know.  After all, I've probably cast it a thousand times before.  Little Lady Jyllia and the little Princess Talara was always getting cut and bruised.  Small wonder, the way they was always climbing all over the palace.\"\nGyna sighed. \"You must have loved Lady Jyllia very much.\"\n\"I still do,\" Ramke beamed. \"But now she's all grown and things are different.  You know, I didn't notice it before because you were all wet from the sea, but you look very much like my lady.  Did I mention that before when we met at the Festival?\"\n\"You did,\" said Gyna. \"Or rather I think you thought I looked like Princess Talara.\"\n\"Oh, it would be so wonderful if you were the Princess returned,\" the old woman gasped. \"You know, when the former royal family was killed, and everyone said the Princess was killed though we never found the body, I think the real victim was Lady Jyllia.  Her little heart just broke, and for a while, it looked like her mind did too.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Gyna. \"What happened?\"\n\"I don't know if I should tell a stranger this, but it's fairly well-known in Camlorn, and I really feel like I know you,\" Ramke struggled with her conscience and then released. \"Jyllia saw the assassination, you see.  I found her afterwards, hiding in that terrible blood-stained throne room, and she was like a little broken doll.  She wouldn't speak, she wouldn't eat.  I tried all my healing spells, but it was quite beyond my power.  So much more than a scraped knee.  Her father who was then Duke of Oloine sent her to a sanitarium in the country to get well.\"\n\"That poor little girl,\" cried Gyna.\n\"It took her years to be herself again,\" said Ramke, nodding. \"And, in truth, she never really returned altogether.  You wonder why her father when he was made king didn't make her his heir?  He thought that she was still not exactly right, and in a way, as much as I would deny it, he's correct to think so.  She remembered nothing, nothing at all.\"\n\"Do you think,\" Gyna considered her words carefully. \"That she would be better if she knew that her cousin the Princess Talara was alive and well?\"\nRamke considered it. \"I think so.  But maybe not.  Sometimes it's best not to hope.\"\nGyna stood up, finding her leg to be as strong as it looked to be.  Her gown had dried, and Ramke gave her a cloak, insisting she protect herself against the cold night air.  At the door, Gyna kissed the old woman's cheek and thanked her.  Not only for the healing spell and for the cloak, but for everything else of kindness she had ever done.\nThe road close to the house went north and south.  To the left was the way back to Camlorn, where secrets lay to which she alone held the key.  To the south was Daggerfall, her home for more than twenty years.  She could return there, back to her profession on the streets, very easily.  For a few seconds, she considered her options, and then made her choice.\nShe had not been walking for very long, when a black carriage drawn by three horses bearing the Imperial Seal, together with eight mounted horses, passed her.  Before it rounded the wooded pass ahead, it stopped suddenly.  She recognized one of the soldiers as Gnorbooth, Lord Strale's manservant.  The door opened and Lord Strale himself, the Emperor's ambassador, the man who had hired her and all the other women to entertain at court, stepped out.\n\"You!' he frowned. \"You're one of the prostitutes, aren't you?  You're the one who disappeared during the Flower Festival?  Gyna, am I right?\"\n\"All that is true,\" she smiled sourly. \"Except my name I've discovered is not Gyna.\"\n\"I don't care what it is,\" said Lord Strale. \"What are you doing on the south road?  I paid for you to stay and make the kingdom merry.\"\n\"If I went back to Camlorn, there are a great many who wouldn't be merry at all.\"\n\"Explain yourself,\" said Lord Strale.\nSo she did.  And he listened.\n\nMystery of Talara, part 3\nThe Mystery \nof\nPrincess Talara\nPart III\nBy\nMera Llykith\nGnorbooth was leaving his favorite pub in Camlorn, The Breaking Branch, when he heard someone calling his name.  His was not the sort of a name that could be mistaken for another.  He turned and saw Lord Eryl, the Royal Battlemage from the palace, emerge from the darkness of the alley.\n\"Milord,\" said Gnorbooth with a pleasant smile.\n\"I'm surprised to see you out this evening, Gnorbooth,\" grinned Lord Eryl with a most unpleasant smile. \"I have not seen you and your master very much since the millennial celebration, but I understand you've been very busy.  What I've been wondering is what you've been busy doing.\"\n\"Protecting the Imperial interests in Camlorn is busy work, milord.  But I cannot imagine you would be interested in the minutiae of the ambassador's appointments.\"\n\"But I am,\" said the battlemage. \"Especially as the ambassador has begun acting most mysteriously, most undiplomatically lately.  And I understand that he has taken one of the whores from the Flower Festival into his house.  I believe her name is Gyna?\"\nGnorbooth shrugged: \"He's in love, I would imagine, milord.  It can make men act very strangely, as I'm sure you've heard before.\"\n\"She is a most comely wench,\" laughed Lord Eryl. \"Have you noticed how much she resembles the late Princess Talara?\"\n\"I have only been in Camlorn for fifteen years, milord.  I never saw her late majesty.\"\n\"Now I could understand it if he had taken to writing poetry, but what man in love spends his days in the kitchens of the palace, talking to old servants?  That hardly sounds like molten passion to me, even based on my limited experience.\" Lord Eryl rolled his eyes. \"And what is this business he has now in - oh, what is the name of that village?\"\n\"Umbington?\" replied Gnorbooth, and immediately wished he hadn't.  Lord Eryl was too canny an actor to reveal it, but Gnorbooth knew at the pit of his stomach that the battlemage did not even know Lord Strale had left the capitol.  He had to get away to let the ambassador know, but there was still a game to be carefully played. \"He's not leaving for there until tomorrow.  I believe it's just to put a stamp on some deed that needs the Imperial seal.\"\n\"Is that all?  How tedious for the poor fellow.  I suppose I'll see him when he returns then,\" Lord Eryl bowed. \"Thank you for being so informative.  Farewell.\"\nThe moment the royal battlemage turned the corner, Gnorbooth leapt onto his horse.  He had drunk one or two ales too many, but he knew he must find his way to Umbington before Lord Eryl's agents did.  He galloped east out of the capitol, hoping there were signs along the road.\nSeated in a tavern that smelled of mildew and sour beer, Lord Strale marveled at how the Emperor's agent Lady Brisienna always found the most public of places for her most private of conferences.  It was harvest time in Umbington, and all of the field hands were drinking away their meager wages in the noisiest of fashions.  He was dressed appropriately for the venue, rough trousers and a simple peasant's vest, but he still felt conspicuous.  In comparison to his two female companions, he certainly was.  The woman to his right was used to frequenting the low places of Daggerfall as a common prostitute.  Lady Brisienna to his left was even more clearly in her element.\n\"By what name would you prefer I call you?\" Lady Brisienna asked solicitously.\n\"I am used to the name Gyna, though that may have to change,\" was her reply. \"Of course, it may not.  Gyna the Whore may be the name writ on my grave.\"\n\"I will see to it that there is no attempt on your life like that the Flower Festival,\" Lord Strale frowned. \"But without the Emperor's help, I won't be able to protect you forever.  The only permanent solution is to capture those who would do you harm and then to raise you to your proper station.\"\n\"Do you believe my story?\" Gyna turned to Lady Brisienna.\n\"I have been the Emperor's chief agent in High Rock for many years now, and I have heard few stranger tales.  If your friend the ambassador hadn't investigated and discovered what he has, I would have dismissed you outright as a madwoman,\" Brisienna laughed, forcing a smile onto Gyna's face to match. \"But now, yes, I do believe you.  Perhaps that makes me the madwoman.\"\n\"Will you help us?\" asked Lord Strale simply.\n\"It is a tricky business interfering in the affairs of the provincial kingdoms,\" Lady Brisienna looked into the depths of her mug thoughtfully. \"Unless there is a threat to the Empire itself, we find it is best not to meddle.  What we have in your case is a very messy assassination that happened twenty years ago, and its aftermath.  If His Imperial Majesty involved itself in every bloody hiccup in the succession in each of his thousand vassal kingdoms, he would never accomplish anything for the greater good of Tamriel.\"\n\"I understand,\" murmured Gyna. \"When I remembered everything, who I was and what happened to me, I resolved to do nothing about it.  In fact, I was leaving Camlorn and going back home to Daggerfall when I saw Lord Strale again.  He was the one who began this quest to resolve this, not me.  And when he brought me back, I only wanted to see my cousin to tell her who I was, but he forbade me.\"\n\"It would have been too dangerous,\" growled Strale. \"We still don't know yet the depths of the conspiracy.  Perhaps we never will.\"\n\"I'm sorry, I always find myself giving long explanations to short questions.  When Lord Strale asked if I would help, I should have begun by saying 'yes,'\" Lady Brisienna laughed at the change in Lord Strale and Gyna's expressions. \"I will help you, of course.  But for this to turn out well, you must accomplish two things to the Emperor's satisfaction.  First, you must prove with absolute certainty who is the power behind this plot you've uncovered.  You must get someone to confess.\"\n\"And secondly,\" said Lord Strale, nodding. \"We must prove that this is a matter worthy of His Imperial Majesty's consideration, and not merely a minor local concern.\"\nLord Strale, Lady Brisienna, and the woman who called herself Gyna discussed how to accomplish their goals for a few hours more.  When it was agreed what had to be done, Lady Brisienna took her leave to find her ally Proseccus.  Strale and Gyna set off to the west, toward Camlorn.  It was not long after beginning their ride through the woods that they heard the sound of galloping hoof beats far up ahead.  Lord Strale unsheathed his sword and signaled for Gyna to position her horse behind him.\nAt that moment, they were attacked on all sides.  It was an ambush. Eight men, armed with axes, had been lying in wait.\nLord Strale quickly yanked Gyna from her horse, pulling her behind him.  He made a brief, deft motion with his hands.  A ring of flame materialized around them, and rushed outward, striking their assailants.  The men roared in pain and dropped to their knees.  Lord Strale jumped the horse over the closest one, and galloped at full speed westward.\n\"I thought you were an ambassador not a mage!\" laughed Gyna.\n\"I still believe there are times for diplomacy,\" replied Lord Strale.\nThe horse and rider they had heard before met them on the road.  It was Gnorbooth. \"Milord, it's the royal battlemage!  He found out you two were in Umbington!\"\n\"With considerable ease, I might add,\" Lord Eryl's voice boomed out of the woods.  Gnorbooth, Gyna, and Lord Strale scanned the dark trees, but they showed nothing.  The battlemage's voice seemed to emanate from everywhere and nowhere.\n\"I'm sorry, milord,\" groaned Gnorbooth. \"I tried to warn you as soon as I could.\"\n\"In your next life, perhaps you'll remember not to trust your plans to a drunkard!\" laughed Lord Eryl.  He had them in his sight, and the spell was unleashed.\nGnorbooth saw him first, by the light of the ball of fire that leapt from his fingertips.  Later, Lord Eryl was to wonder to himself what the fool had intended to do.  Perhaps he was rushing forward to pull Lord Strale out of the path.  Perhaps he was trying to flee the path of destruction, and had simply moved left when he should have moved right.  Perhaps, as unlikely as it seemed, he was willing to sacrifice himself to save his master.  Whatever the reason, the result was the same.\nHe got in the way.\nThere was an explosion of energy that filled the night, and an echoing boom that shook birds from the trees for a mile around. On the few square feet where Gnorbooth and his horse had stood was nothing but black glass.  They had been reduced to less than vapor.  Gyna and Lord Strale were thrown back.  Their horse, when it recovered its senses, galloped away as fast as it could.  In the lingering glowing aura of the spell's detonation, Lord Strale looked straight into the woods and into the wide eyes of the battlemage.\n\"Damn,\" said Lord Eryl and began to run.  The ambassador jumped to his feet and pursued.\n\"That was an expensive use of magicka, even for you,\" said Lord Strale as he ran. \"Don't you know well enough not to use ranged spells unless you are certain your target won't be blocked?\"\n\"I never thought - that idiot -\" Lord Eryl was struck from behind and knocked to the wet forest floor before he had a chance to finish his lamentation.\n\"It doesn't matter what you thought,\" said Lord Strale calmly, flipping the battlemage around and pinning his arms to the ground with his knees. \"I'm not a battlemage, but I knew enough not to use my entire reserve on your little ambush.  Perhaps it's a matter of philosophy, as a government agent, I feel inclined toward conservatism.\"\n\"What are you going to do?\" whimpered Lord Eryl.\n\"Gnorbooth was a good man, one of the best, and so I'm going to hurt you quite a lot,\" the ambassador made a slight movement and his hands began to glow brightly. \"That's a certainty.  How much more I'm going to hurt you after that depends on what you tell me.  I want to hear about the former Duke of Oloine.\"\n\"What do you want to know?\" Lord Eryl screamed.\n\"Let's start with everything,\" replied Lord Strale with perfect patience.\n\nMystery of Talara, part 4\nThe Mystery of Princess Talara\nPart IV\nby \nMera Llykith\nGyna never saw the Emperor's agent Lady Brisienna again, but she kept her promise. Proseccus, a nightblade in the service of the Empire, arrived at Lord Strale's house in disguise. She was an apt pupil, and within days, he had taught what she needed to know.\n\"It is a simple charm, not the sort of spell that could turn a raging daedroth into a love-struck puppy,\" said Proseccus. \"If you do or say anything that would normally anger or offend your target, the power will weaken. It will alter temporarily his perception of you, as spells of the school of illusion do, but his feelings of respect and admiration for you must be supported by means of a charm of a less magickal nature.\"\n\"I understand,\" smiled Gyna, thanking her tutor for the two spells of illusion he had taught her. The time had come to use her new-found skill.\nThe Prostitutes Guildhouse of Camlorn was a great palace in an affluent northern quarter of the city. Prince Sylon could have found his way there blindfolded, or blind drunk as he often was. Tonight, however, he was only lightly inebriated and he resolved to drink no more. Tonight he was in the mood for pleasure. His kind of pleasure.\n\"Where is my favorite, Grigia?\" he demanded of the Guildmistress upon entering.\n\"She is still healing from your appointment with her last week,\" she smiled serenely. \"Most of the other women are in with clients as well, but I saved a special treat for you. A new girl. One you will certainly enjoy.\"\nThe Prince was guided to a sumptuously decorated suite of velvet and silk. As he entered, Gyna stepped from behind a screen and cast her spell quickly, with her mind open to belief as Proseccus had instructed. It was hard to tell if it worked at first. The Prince looked at her with a cruel smile and then, like sun breaking through clouds, the cruelty left. She could tell he was hers. He asked her her name.\n\"I am between names right now,\" she teased. \"I've never made love to a real prince before. I've never even been inside a palace. Is yours very ... big?\"\n\"It's not mine yet,\" he shrugged. \"But someday I'll be king.\"\n\"It would be wonderful to live in such a place,\" Gyna cooed. \"A thousand years of history. Everything must be so old and beautiful. The paintings and books and statues and tapestries. Does your family hold onto all their old treasures?\"\n\"Yes, hoarded away with a lot of boring old junk in the archive rooms in the vaults. Please, may I see you naked now?\"\n\"First a little conversation, though you may feel free to disrobe whenever you like,\" said Gyna. \"I had heard there was an archive room, but it's quite hidden away.\"\n\"There's a false wall behind the family crypt,\" said the Prince, gripping her wrist and pulling her towards him for a kiss. Something in his eyes had changed.\n\"Your Highness, you're hurting my arm,\" Gyna cried.\n\"Enough talk, you bewitching whore,\" he snarled. Holding back a sharp jab of fear, Gyna let her mind cool and perceptions whirl. As his angry mouth touched her lips, she cast the second spell she had learned her illusionist mentor.\nThe Prince felt his flesh turn to stone. He remained frozen, watching Gyna pull together her clothing and leave the room. The paralysis would only last for a few more minutes, but it was all the time she needed.\nThe Guildmistress had already left with all her girls, just as Gyna and Lord Strale had told her to. They would tell her when it was safe to return. She had not even accepted any gold for her part in the trap. She said it was enough that her girls would not be tortured anymore by that most perverse and cruel Prince.\n\"What a terrible boy,\" thought Gyna as she raised the hood on her cloak and raced through the streets toward Lord Strale's house. \"It is good that he will never be king.\"\nThe following morning, the King and Queen of Camlorn held their daily audience with various nobles and diplomats, a sparse gathering. The throne room was largely empty. It was a terribly dull way to begin the day. In between petitions, they yawned regally.\n\"What has happened to all the interesting people?\" the Queen murmured. \"Where's our precious boy?\"\n\"I've heard he was raging through the north quarter in search of some harlot who robbed him,\" the King chuckled fondly. \"What a fine lad.\"\n\"And what of the Royal Battlemage?\"\n\"I've sent him to take care of a delicate matter,\" the King knit his brow. \"But that was nearly a week ago, and I haven't heard one word from him. It's somewhat troubling.\"\n\"Indeed it is, Lord Eryl should not be gone so long,\" the Queen frowned. \"What if a rogue sorcerer came and threatened us? Husband, don't laugh at me, that is why all the royal houses of High Rock keep their mage retainers close to their side. To protect their court from evil enchantments, like the one that our poor Emperor suffered so recently.\"\n\"At the hand of his own battlemage,\" chuckled the King\n\"Lord Eryl would never betray you like that, and you well know it. He has been in your employ since you were Duke of Oloine. To even make that comparison between he and Jagar Tharn, really,\" the Queen waved her hands dismissively. \"It is that sort of lack of trust that is ruining kingdoms all over Tamriel. Now, Lord Strale tells me -\"\n\"There's another man that's gone missing,\" mused the King.\n\"The ambassador?\" the Queen shook her head. \"No, he's here. He was desirous to visit the crypts and pay homage to your noble ancestors, so I directed him there. I can't think what's keeping him so long. He must be more pious than I thought.\"\nShe was surprised to see the King rise up, alarmed. \"Why didn't you tell me?\"\nBefore she had a chance to reply, the subject of their conversation was coming through the open door to the throne room. At on his arm was a beautiful fair-haired woman in a stately gown of scarlet and gold, worthy of the highest nobility. The queen followed her startled husband's gaze, and was likewise amazed.\n\"I had heard he was taken with one of the harlots from the Flower Festival, not a lady,\" she whispered. \"Why, she looks remarkably like your daughter, the Lady Jyllia.\"\n\"That she does,\" the King gasped. \"Or her cousin, the Princess Talara.\"\nThe nobles in the room also whispered amongst themselves. Though few had been at court twenty years ago when the Princess had disappeared, presumed murdered like the rest of the royal family, there were still a few elder statesmen who remembered. It was not only on throne that the word \"Talara\" passed through the air like an enchantment.\n\"Lord Strale, will you introduce us to your lady?\" the Queen asked with a polite smile.\n\"In a moment, your highness, but I'm afraid I must first discuss pressing matters,\" Lord Strale replied with a bow. \"Might I request a private audience?\"\nThe King looked at the Imperial ambassador, trying to read into the man's expression. With a wave of his hand, he dismissed the assembled and had the doors shut behind them. No one remained in the audience room but the King, the Queen, the ambassador, a dozen royal guards, and the mysterious woman.\nThe ambassador pulled from his pocket a sheaf of old yellowed parchment. \"Your Highness, when you ascended the throne after your brother and his family were murdered, anything that seemed important, deeds and wills, were of course kept with the clerks and ministers. His entire incidental, unimportant personal correspondence was sent to archive which is standard protocol. This letter was among them.\"\n\"What is this all about, sir?\" the King boomed. \"What does it say?\"\n\"Nothing about you, your majesty. In truth, at the time of your majesty's ascension, no one reading it could have understood its significance. It was a letter to the Emperor the late king your brother was penning at the time of his assassination, concerning a thief who had once been a mage-priest at the Temple of Sethiete here in Camlorn. His name was Jagar Tharn.\"\n\"Jagar Tharn?\" the Queen laughed nervously. \"Why, we were just talking about him.\"\n\"Tharn had stolen many books of powerful and forgotten spells, and lore about such artifacts as the Staff of Chaos, where it was hidden and how it could be used. News travels slowly to westernmost High Rock, and by the time the King your brother had heard that the Emperor's new battlemage was a man named Jagar Tharn, many years had passed. The king had been writing a letter to warn the Emperor of the treachery of his Imperial Battlemage, but it was never completed.\" Lord Strale held up the letter. \"It is dated on the day of his assassination in the year 385. Four years before Jagar Tharn betrayed his master, and began the ten years of tyranny of the Imperial Simulacrum.\"\n\"This is all very interesting,\" the King barked. \"But what has it to do with me?\"\n\"The late King's assassination is now a matter of Imperial concern. And I have a confession from your Royal Battlemage Lord Eryl.\"\nThe King's face lost all color: \"You miserable worm, no man may threaten me. Neither you, nor that whore, nor that letter will ever see the light of day again. Guards!\"\nThe royal guards unsheathed their blades and pressed forward. As they did so, there was a sudden shimmering of light and the room was filled with Imperial nightblades, led by Proseccus. They had been there for hours, lurking invisibly in the shadows.\n\"In the name of His Imperial Majesty, Uriel Septim VII, I arrest you,\" said Strale.\nThe doors were opened, and the King and Queen were led out, heads bowed. Gyna told Proseccus where he would most likely find their son, Prince Sylon. The courtiers and nobles who had been in the audience chamber stared at the strange, solemn procession of their King and Queen to their own royal prison. No one said a word.\nWhen at last a voice was heard, it startled all. The Lady Jyllia had arrived at court. \"What is happening? Who dares to usurp the authority of the King and Queen?\"\nLord Strale turned to Proseccus: \"We would speak with the Lady Jyllia alone. You know what needs to be done.\"\nProseccus nodded and had the doors to the throne room closed once again. The courtiers pressed against the wood, straining to hear everything. Though they could not say it, they wanted an explanation almost as much as her Ladyship did.\nMystery of Talara, part 5\nThe Mystery of\nPrincess Talara\nPart V\nby\nMera Llykith\nBy what right do you arrest my father?\" cried the Lady Jyllia. \"What has he done?\"\n\"I arrest the King of Camlorn, the former Duke of Oloine, by my right as an Imperial Commanding Officer and Ambassador,\" said Lord Strale. \"By the right of law of the Emperor of Tamriel which supercedes all provincial royal authority.\"\nGyna came forward and tried to put her hand on Jyllia's arm, but she was coldly rebuffed.  Quietly, she sat down at the foot of the throne in the now empty audience chamber.\n\"This young lady came to me, having completely recovered her memory, but the story she told was beyond incredible, I simply couldn't believe it,\" said Lord Strale. \"But she was so convinced of it, I had to investigate.  So I talked to everyone who was here at the palace twenty years ago to see if there could be any truth to it.  Of course, at the time of the King and Queen's murder, and the Princess's disappearance, there was a full inquiry made, but I had different questions to ask this time.  Questions about the relationship between the two little cousins, Lady Jyllia Raze and the Princess.\"\n\"I've told everyone over and over again, I don't remember anything at all about that time in my life,\" said Jyllia, tears welling up.\n\"I know you don't.  There has never been a question in my mind that you witnessed a horrible murder, and that your memory lapse and hers,\" said Lord Strale, gesturing toward Gyna \"Are both very real. The story I heard from the servants and other people at the palace was that the little girls were inseparably close.  There were no other playmates, and as the Princess's place was to be close to her parents, so the little Lady Jyllia was always there as well.  When the assassin came to murder the Royal Family, the King and Queen were in their bedroom, and the girls were playing in the throne room.\"\n\"When my memory came back to me, it was like opening a sealed box,\" said Gyna solemnly. \"Everything was so clear and detailed, like it all happened yesterday not twenty years ago.  I was on the throne, playing Empress, and you were hiding behind the dais, pretending you were in a dungeon I had sent you to.  A man I had never seen burst into the room from the Royal bedchamber, his blade soaked in blood.  He came at me, and I ran for my life.  I remember starting to run for the dais, but I saw your face, frozen in fear, and I didn't want to lead him to you.  So I ran for the window.\n\"We had climbed on the outside of the castle before, just for fun, that was one of the first memories that came back to me when I was holding onto that cliff.  You and I on the castle wall, and the King calling up to me, telling me how to get down.  But that day, I couldn't hold on, I was trembling so much.  I just fell, and landed in the river.\n\"I don't know if it was entirely the horror of what I had seen, or that combined with the impact of the fall and the coldness of the water, but everything just went blank in my mind.  When I finally pulled myself out of the river, many miles away, I had no idea who I was.  And so it stayed,\" Gyna smiled. \"Until now.\"\n\"So you are the Princess Talara?\" cried Jyllia.\n\"Let me explain further before she answers that, because the simple answer would just confuse you, as it did me,\" said Lord Strale. \"The assassin was caught before he managed to escape the palace - in truth, he had to know he was going to be caught.  He confessed immediately to the murders of the Royal Family.  The Princess, he said, he had thrown out the window to her death.  A servant down below heard the scream, and saw something fly past his window, so he knew it to be true.\n\"It was not for several hours that little Lady Jyllia was found by her nursemaid Ramke hiding behind the dais, coated with dust, shivering with fear, and unable to speak at all.  Ramke was very protective of you,\" Strale said, nodding to Jyllia. \"She insisted on putting you to your room right away, and sent word the Duke of Oloine that the Royal Family was dead, and that his daughter had witnessed the murders but survived.\"\n\"I'm beginning to remember a little of that,\" said Jyllia, wonderingly. \"I remember lying in bed, with Ramke comforting me.  I was so muddled and I couldn't concentrate.  I remember I just wanted it all to be play time still, I don't know why.  And then, I remember being bundled up and taken to that asylum.\"\n\"It'll all come back to you soon,\" Gyna smiled. \"I promise.  That's how I began to remember.  I just caught one detail, and the whole flood began.\"\n\"That's it,\" Jyllia began to sob in frustration. \"I don't remember anything else except confusion.  No, I also remember Daddy not even looking at me as I was taken away.  And I remember not caring about that, or anything else.\"\n\"It was a confusing time for all, so particularly so for little girls.  Especially little girls who went through what you two did,\" said Lord Strale sympathetically. \"From what I understand, as soon as he received the message from Ramke, the Duke left his palace at Oloine, gave orders for you to be sent to a private sanitarium until you'd recovered from your ordeal, and set to work with his private guard torturing the assassin for information.  When I heard that, that no one but the Duke and his personal guard saw the assassin after he gave his initial confession, and that no one was present but the Duke and his guards when the assassin was killed trying to escape, I thought that very significant.\n\"I spoke with Lord Eryl, who I knew was one of those present, and I had to bluff him, pretending I had more evidence than I did.  I got the reaction I was hoping for, though it was a dangerous gambit.  At last he confessed to what I already knew to be true.\n\"The assassin,\" Lord Strale paused, and reluctantly met Jyllia's eyes, \"Had been hired by the Duke of Oloine to kill the Royal Family, including the Princess as heir, so that the crown might be passed to him and to his children.\"\nJyllia stared at Lord Strale, aghast. \"My father -\"\n\"The assassin had been told that once the Duke had him in custody, he would be paid and a prison break would be arranged.  The thug picked the wrong time to be greedy and try to get more gold.  The Duke decided that it would be cheaper to silence him, so he murdered him then and there, so the man would never tell anyone what really happened,\" Lord Strale shrugged. \"No tragic loss as far as murders go.  In a few years' time, you returned from the sanitarium, a little shaken but back to normal, except for a complete absence of memory about your childhood.  And in that time, the former Duke of Oloine had taken his brother's place as the King of Camlorn. It was no small maneuver.\"\n\"No,\" said Jyllia, quietly. \"He must have been very busy.  He remarried and had another child.  No one ever came to visit me in the sanitarium but Ramke.\"\n\"If he had visited and seen you,\" said Gyna. \"This story might have turned out very differently.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Jyllia.\n\"This is the most amazing part,\" said Lord Strale. \"The question has long been whether Gyna is the Princess Talara.  When her memory returned, and she told me what she remembered, I put several pieces of evidence together.  Consider these facts.\n\"The two of you look remarkably alike now after twenty years of living very different lives, and as little girls and constant playmates, you looked nearly identical.\n\"At the time of the assassination, the murderer who had never been there before, only saw one girl on the throne, who he assumed to be his quarry.\n\"The woman who found Lady Jyllia was her nursemaid Ramke, a creature of unstable mind and fanatical devotion to her charge - the type would never accept the possibility that her beloved little girl had been the one who disappeared.  The nursemaid was the only single person who knew both Princess Talara and the Lady Jyllia who visited you while you were in the sanitarium.\n\"Finally,\" said Lord Strale, \"Consider the fact that when you returned to court from the sanitarium, five years had past, and you had grown from a child to a young lady.  You looked familiar, but not quite the same as your family remembered you, which is only natural.\"\n\"I don't understand,\" cried the poor girl, her eyes wide, because she did understand.  Here memory was falling together like a terrible flood.\n\"Let me explain it like this,\" said her cousin, wrapping her in her arms. \"I know who I am now.  My real name is Jyllia Raze.  That man who was arrested was my father, the man who murdered the King - your father.  YOU are the Princess Talara.\"\n"

Mighty Tiber Septim, himself the first emperor, conqueror of all Tamriel, ascended to godhood to sit at the right hand of Akatosh. Tiber Septim, a true son of Skyrim, born in the land of snow and blood, bred to the honor of our people, is now Talos, god of might and honor. The Empire has no right to tell us we cannot worship him.\nOur own high king, Torygg, betrayed us to the empire. He traded our god for peace. He agreed to a pact with the Thalmor signed by an emperor in a foreign land. Are we to be beholden to such a pact? No! A thousand times no.\nDo not let the lessons of history go unheeded. The Aldmeri Dominion and its Thalmor masters made war upon men, just as the elves made war upon Ysgramor and our people in ancient times. Shining Saarthal was burned to the ground, reduced to ruins and rubble in their treacherous assault. But Ysgramor and his sons gathered the 500 Companions and made war upon the elves, casting them out of Skyrim. In the Great War fought by our fathers, the elves again betrayed men by attacking us unprovoked. The Dominion and the Thalmor cannot be trusted!\nLike Ysgramor, Ulfric Stormcloak is a true hero of Skyrim. His name will ring in Sovngarde for generations to come. Only he had the courage to single out King Torygg and challenge him to trial by arms. Ulfric's thu'um, a gift from Talos himself, struck down this traitorous ruler. And by his death we are now free of our Imperial shackles and the Thalmor overlords that darken the Imperial throne.\nThe Empire has sent its Legions to govern us. They have enlisted our own countrymen to their cause. They have set brother against brother, father against son. They have caused Skyrim to battle itself in their name, for their cause. Do not let them divide us. Do not let them conquer us! Reject the Imperial law that forbids the worship of Talos. Join Ulfric Stormcloak and his cause!"

But, more importantly, I am a Nord born and raised in the land of Skyrim.\nI write this volume in the desperate hope that the rest of Tamriel can come to know my people as they deserve to be known, and understand this province for what it truly is - a place of uncontested beauty and culture.\nSome of what you know is undoubtedly true. Physically, we Nords are an impressive, often imposing sight - tall of stature, strong of bone, and thick of muscle. Our hair is often fair, and worn braided, as has been the custom for generations. Often we are swathed in the hides of beasts, for such creatures are abundant in Skyrim, and we would be foolish not to take advantage of such an available resource.\nHaving read this far, you may be shocked at the strength of my words, and the literacy of a northern \"savage.\" Aye, many Nords can both read and write. My father began my instruction in the way of letters when I was but a bairn, as did his father, and his father before him.\nBut the accomplishments of the children of Skyrim are multitude, and go beyond mere wordcraft. For we are artisans as well, and through the ages have learned to manipulate steel the way a sculptor would clay.\nIndeed, I have seen with mine own eyes, visitors from High Rock and Cyrodiil weep in disbelief as they beheld the blades wrought in the fires of the Skyforge, and honed to beautiful deadliness by the gods-touched hands of Clan Gray-Mane.\nBut how can this be true, you ask? How are such achievements possible from a people who have yet to emerge from the muck and snow? Again, provincial bias clouds the truth.\nThe cities of Skyrim are a testament to Nord ingenuity and craftsmanship. Chief among them are Solitude, seat of the High King and capital of the province; Windhelm, ancient and honored, a jewel in the snow; Markarth, carved into the living rock itself, in ages long since past; Riften, nestled in the golden shadows of the Fall Forest, whence comes delicious fish and mead; and Whiterun, built around the hall of Jorrvaskr, home of the most noble Companions and revered Skyforge.\nAnd now, respected reader, you have the full measure of it. We Nords are everything you imagined - and so much more.\nBut let not this work be your only gateway to the truth. Book passage on carriage or vessel, and make the journey north. See Skyrim with thine own eyes. See Skyrim as have the Nords, since the gods first shaped the world."

    "text": "Of Crossed Daggers:\nThe History of Riften\nby\nDwennon Wyndell\nSituated on the eastern banks of Lake Honrich, the city of Riften serves as a reminder of a bygone era. The once-proud streets and buildings have vanished and been replaced with a collection of wooden structures and rough stonework shrouded in a permanent fog-like mist. In order to understand how such a large city became nothing more than a glorified fortress, one need only look to the history books for answers.\nRiften was a major hub of activity for trade caravans and travellers to and from Morrowind. Fishing skiffs could be seen dotting the lake at all hours of the day and the bustling city was alive with activity at night. The city guard was formiddable and maintained a tight grasp on its populace, keeping them safe from harm. The marketplace in Riften was also quite a draw, containing numerous stands offering wares from across Tamriel.\nIn 4E 98, amidst the confusion of the Void Nights, Hosgunn Crossed-Daggers was installed as Jarl when the previous Jarl had been assassinated. Although many believe that Hosgunn was responisble, and cries of protest filled the streets of Riften, the Jarl took the throne and immediately took action to protect his station. Using the city guard, he had the streets cleared of protesters and initiated a curfew. Any caught breaking the curfew was immediately jailed without process or executed if it was a repeat offence.\nFor over 40 years, Hosgunn ruled Riften with a black heart and an iron fist. He imposed ridiculous taxes upon his subjects and any merchants that wished to sell their wares within the city walls. Hosgunn kept most of the coin for himself, using it to construct a massive wooden castle with unecessarily lavish quartering within. The castle took seven years to build, and became a visual reminder of the people's oppression which earned it the nickname \"Hosgunn's Folly.\" Towards the end of his reign, the streets of Riften became littered with refuse and it's people plagued by disease and hunger.\nThen, in 4E 129, the people had finally had enough. With their numbers, they were able to temporarily overhwhelm the city guard long enough to set Hosgunn's Folly on fire with the greedy Jarl still within. As the fighting recommensed, the fire spread through the city unchecked. By the morning, the people had emerged victorious, but not without great cost. Most of the city was now in ruins and many had died.\nIt took five years to rebuild Riften into the smaller city that it is today. And even though over fifty years had passed since then, it still has yet to fully recover. Some believe it will never achieve the level of affluence it saw at the beginning of the Fourth Era, but there are a few who still hold on to the hope that Riften can return from the ashes and become a center of commerce once again."

    "description": "Explores the various legends of the story of King Olaf and his capture of the dragon Numinex.",
    "text": "One of the more colorful legends in Nord folklore is the tale of Olaf One-Eye and Numinex.\nLong ago in the First Age, a fearsome dragon named Numinex ravaged the whole of Skyrim. The dreadful drake wiped out entire villages, burned cities and killed countless Nords. It seemed that no power in Tamriel could stop the monster.\nThis was a troubled time in Skyrim's history, for a bitter war of succession raged between the holds. The Jarls might have been able to conquesr the beast if they had worked together, but trust was in desperately short supply.\nA skillful warrior named Olaf came forward and promised to defeat the beast. In some accounts, he is the Jarl of Whiterun. In other versions of the legend, Olaf promises the people of Whiterun that he will capture the monster if they will name him Jarl.\nAt any rate, Olaf ventures forth with a handful of his most trusted warriors and seeks the beast out, eventually finding Numinex in his lair atop Mount Athor. Needless to say, it's an epic battle.\nFirst, Olaf comes at the dragon with his axe and his shield. Some variants of the legend say that Olaf and the beast battled with blade and claw for days, but were too evenly matched for either to gain an advantage.\nMost accounts hold that Olaf, perhaps frustrated that his weapons are completely ineffectual against the dragon, finally casts them aside. Giving voice to the rage that has been building within him, Olaf unleashes a terrible shout.\nHere again, the stories diverge. Many accounts hold that Olaf did not realize he possessed the power of Dragon-speech, while others suggest that he had long possessed this gift, but wished to test himself against the dragon in martial combat first.\nVirtually all variations of the legend, however, agree on what happened next.\nUsing the awesome powers of the Dragon language, Numinex and Olaf engage in an epic shouting duel atop Mount Athor. So forceful are their words, they are said to shatter the stone and split the sky.\nFinally, Numinex collapses from a combination of injury and sheer exhaustion. Somehow - and this detail is conspicuously absent in virtually every account - Olaf manages to convey the dragon all the way back to the capital city of Whiterun.\nThe people of Whiterun are suitably impressed with Olaf's hostage. They build a huge stone holding cell at the rear of the palace, which they rename \"Dragonsreach\". This enormous cell serves as Numinex's prison until his death.\nOlaf himself eventually becomes the High King of Skyrim, putting an end to the war of succession. Presumably, his great deed made him the only leader upon whom all the people could agree, and so the land once again has peace.\nAs a visitor to Skyrim, I find this tale both fascinating and highly entertaining. It is one the most celebrated legends of the Nords, and one can easily understand why. It's a story of surpassing heroism, in which a resourceful and worthy Nord does battle with a truly terrifying adversary and emerges victorious by yelling him into submission. The only way in which this could have been even more of a Nordic tale would be if Olaf beat Numinex in a drinking contest.\nThe legend is not without its doubters, however. The bard Svaknir, who lived during Olaf's reign, wrote and performed an alliterative verse that challenged Olaf's version of events. Enraged, the High King threw the rebellious bard in prison and destroyed all written copies of the verse.\nHow I would love to lay hands on a copy of that verse! I admit, I am immensely curious to know what assertions Svaknir made about how Olaf really defeated Numinex.\nThere are a few ancient bard texts that provide one possible answer. These tomes suggest that Numinex was particularly foul-tempered because he was extremely old. In these accounts, the dragon spends his final years terrorizing the country side before flying off to the top of Mount Athor to die in peace.\nWhen Olaf finds Numinex, the dragon is too weak to defend himself. Olaf and his men capture the beast without effort, but decide to take advantage of the situation by fabricating a heroic tale. It is worth noting that all of Olaf's warriors who were said to witness the shout duel went on to become wealthy leaders during Olaf's reign as High King.\nHowever, it is equally likely that Svaknir had some grudge against Olaf, and his scandalous verse was an attempt to damage the High King's reputation. Alas, we will never know.\nI leave you now, good reader, with this gentle reminder: A good historian must remain impartial, and consider all points of view. Time has a way of distorting our record of events, so the closer you can get to the original sources, the better!"

    "text": "On Stepping Lightly:\nThe Nordic Ruins of Skyrim\nby\n\tSigilis Justus\n\nDotting the landscape of Skyrim, the ancient Nordic Ruins are a testament to the ingenuity of the Nordic people of the past. When constructing the final resting places of their noble class, these supposedly \"barbaric\" people proved quite the opposite; developing some of the most sophisticated and clever defenses ever encountered. Coupled with the presence of the fearsome draugr, these tombs have become quite a challenge for the would-be treasure hunter.\nThe most often-overlooked obstacles are the abundance of traps spread throughout the tombs. Ranging from simple tripwire-activated rock falls to complex pressure plate-triggered dart traps, the Nords utilize these devices abundantly. Most of the traps can be avoided by simply looking for the trigger mechanism and avoiding them. Since they are most often placed in areas where distractions abound, remember to keep your eyes to the floor.\nOne of the keys to survival in a Nordic Ruin is through the clever use of these traps to gain an upper hand against its denizens. In many cases, it's trivial to lure them across the triggering mechanism in hopes that they'll fall victim to the trap's effect. This advantage can come heavily into play when encountering an oil trap. Using a ranged attack, lure your victim onto the oil and then loose an arrow at the fire pot hanging above. The moment the fire pot shatters, the entire pool of oil will ignite and engulf the enemy. Just be certain that you're standing clear of the oil yourself, or else this trick could end your expedition in an untimely manner.\nPerhaps one of the most amazing engineering marvels of all to be found in the ruins has little to do with the traps designed to kill. Utilizing all manner of pull chains, levers, switches and pressure plates, some of the most frustrating obstacles can occur in the form of puzzles that could threaten to block your progress. Watch for the telltale signs of these barriers: groups of levers in a single place, rotating pillars with carvings on all faces and even large arrays of pressure plates covering the floor of a room. In most cases, the puzzle might take experimentation, in others the solution could actually be present elsewhere in the complex. It's recommended to keep a writing implement and a journal handy in the latter case.\nAlthough Nordic Ruins are commonly infested with vermin such as skeever and spiders, these creatures pale in comparison to the mighty draugr. These horrific, animated dead beings are commonly found as guardians in most of the tombs and will defend them mercilessly. Since the draugr tends to lay dormant until someone happens upon their resting place, it's advisable to keep an eye on any niches or sarcophaguses that you encounter. These undead beings animate rather rapidly and silently, so always watch your back - any remains you may have passed could suddenly animate and set upon you without warning.\nThe perils of the Nordic Ruin are not without reward. The burial chambers in some of the larger complexes have been known to contain all manners of riches, from gold coins to even the occasional enchanted weapon or armor. Never dismiss the small ceremonial urns that dot the ruins, they are commonly filled with ancient offerings of great value. There are rumors that most, if not all of these ruins contain large walls with magical inscriptions upon them, but these have yet to be confirmed.\nWhile this might seem like comprehensive guide to the ruins, there are certain to be dangers lurking within that remain undiscovered. Just be sure to always enter these tombs with plenty of equipment and a good, solid weapon by your side. With a bit of patience, a keen eye and a light step, the Nordic Ruin can bring you great wealth - do without these simple safety measures and you risk becoming a permanent resident like many before you."

    "text": "To the esteemed Jarl Valdimar of Winterhold,\nFirst, please allow me to offer my most sincere condolences. I understand that you, like many others, have lost family and you have my deepest sympathies.\nI also understand that some on your council have placed the blame for this horrible disaster on my colleagues at the College. While I can certainly appreciate the shock at the scope of recent events, and the desire to comprehend what has happened, I must strongly urge you to consider the full situation.\nYou know as well as any the College's history and reputation in Winterhold. It has long been a source of pride for your city, a unique fixture in Skyrim. Some of the greatest wizards have studied here, and the College has always promoted positive relations with the other provinces of Tamriel.\nIt is well-known that those relations have been, shall we say, strained over the last few decades. After the Oblivion Crisis, it was only natural that the people of Skyrim showed a distrust for mages, even though the vast majority of us actively worked to counter the actions of the Mythic Dawn cult. The College expected such a reaction, and hoped that distrust would fade over time.\nAnd then, the Red Year. No one foresaw the explosion of Red Mountain, or the devastating effect it would have on the Dunmer culture. Your predecessor was kind enough to welcome many of the refugees, particularly those who could contribute to the College's studies. We were quite grateful.\nWhen Solstheim was generously offered to the Dunmer as a new home, I was as surprised as any. I did not, however, share the apparent expectation that all dark elves would leave Skyrim. It did not go unnoticed that many in Winterhold were unhappy at how many mages chose to stay at the College rather than relocate.\nAnd now, the storms that have wracked the coast of Skyrim for close to a year have finally broken, but at great cost to us all. This great collapse that has devastated Winterhold was unexpected, I assure you. That the College has remained unaffected is only a testament to the protective magicks placed around it so long ago. It in no way implies that we were somehow prepared specifically for this event, and is certainly no indication that the College was somehow responsible.\nI certainly would never hold you accountable for the gossip spread amongst the people of Winterhold. I would urge you, though, to not allow that gossip to take root and become a commonly held belief. I do not wish to see our relationship crumble like Winterhold has, as I assure you the College will remain here a very, very long time.\nYour persistent advocate,\nArch-Mage Deneth"

    "text": "In the wilds of most every province of Tamriel, descended philosophically if not directly from the original inhabitants of the land, are the Ayleids, commonly called the Wild Elves. While three races of Elven stock -- the Altmer (or High Elves), the Bosmer (or Wood Elves), and the Dunmer (or Dark Elves) -- have assimilated well into the new cultures of Tamriel, the Ayleids and their brethren have remained aloof toward our civilization, preferring to practice the old ways far from the eyes of the world.\nThe Wild Elves speak a variation of Old Cyrodilic, opting to shun Tamrielic and separating themselves from the mainstream of Tamriel even further than the least urbanized of their Elven cousins. In temperament they are dark-spirited and taciturn -- though this is from the point of view of outsiders (or \"Pellani\" in their tongue), and doubtless they act differently within their own tribes.\nIndeed, one of the finest sages of the University of Gwilym was a civilized Ayleid Elf, Tjurhane Fyrre (1E2790-2E227), whose published work on Wild Elves suggests a lively, vibrant culture. Fyrre is one of the very few Ayleids to speak freely on his people and religion, and he himself said \"the nature of the Ayleid tribes is multihued, their personalities often wildly different from their neighbor[ing] tribes\" (Fyrre, T., Nature of Ayleidic Poesy, p. 8, University of Gwilym Press, 2E12).\nLike any alien culture, Wild Elves are often feared by the simple people of Tamriel. The Ayleids continue to be one of the greatest enigmas of the continent of Tamriel. They seldom appear in the pages of written history in any role, and then only as a strange sight a chronicler stumbles upon before they vanish into the wood. When probable fiction is filtered from common legend, we are left with almost nothing. The mysterious ways of the Ayleids have remained shrouded since before the First Era, and may well remain so for thousands of years to come."

So it passed that the Daedra Molag Bal looked on Arkay and thought the Aedra prideful of his dominion o'er the death of man and mer, and it was sooth.\nBal, whose sphere is the wanton oppression and entrapment of mortal souls, sought to thwart Arkay, who knew that not man, nor mer, nor beastfolk of all Nirn could escape eventual death.  The Aedra was doubtless of his sphere, and so Molag Bal set upon Nirn to best death.\nTamriel was still young, and filled with danger and wondrous magick when Bal walked in the aspect of a man and took a virgin, Lamae Beolfag, from the Nedic Peoples.  Savage and loveless, Bal profaned her body, and her screams became the Shrieking Winds, which still haunt certain winding fjords of Skyrim.  Shedding a lone droplet of blood on her brow, Bal left Nirn, having sown his wrath.\nViolated and comatose, Lamae was found by nomads, and cared for.  A fortnight hence, the nomad wyrd-woman enshrouded Lamae in pall for she had passed into death.  In their way, the nomads built a bonfire to immolate the husk.  That night, Lamae rose from her funeral pyre, and set upon the coven, still aflame.  She ripped the throats of the women, ate the eyes of the children, and raped their men as cruelly as Bal had ravished her.\nAnd so; Lamae, (who is known to us as blood-matron) imprecated her foul aspect upon the folk of Tamriel, and begat a brood of countless abominations, from which came the vampires, most cunning of the night-horrors.  And so was the scourge of undeath wrought upon Tamriel, cruelly mocking Arkay's rhythm of life and death through all the coming eras of the et'Ada, and for all his sadness, Arkay knew this could not be undone."

    "text": "Palla, Volume 1\nPalla\nBook I\n\nby \nVojne Mierstyyd\nPalla.  Pal La.  I remember when I first heard that name, not long ago at all.  It was at a Tales and Tallows ball at a very fine estate west of Mir Corrup, to which I and my fellow Mages Guild initiates had found ourselves unexpectedly invited.  Truth be told, we needn't have been too surprised.  There were very few other noble families in Mir Corrup -- the region had its halcyon days as a resort for the wealthy far back in the 2nd era -- and on reflection, it was only appropriate to have sorcerers and wizards present at a supernatural holiday.  Not that we were anything more exotic than students at a small, nonexclusive charterhouse of the Guild, but like I said, there was a paucity of other choices available.\nFor close to a year, the only home I had known was the rather ramshackle if sprawling grounds of the Mir Corrup Mages Guild.  My only companions were my fellow initiates, most of which only tolerated me, and the masters, whose bitterness at being at a backwater Guild prompted never-ending abuse.\nImmediately the School of Illusion had attracted me.  The Magister who taught us recognized me as an apt pupil who loved not only the spells of the science but their philosophical underpinnings.  There was something about the idea of warping the imperceptible energies of light, sound, and mind that appealed to my nature.  Not for me the flashy schools of destruction and alteration, the holy schools of restoration and conjuration, the practical schools of alchemy and enchantment, or the chaotic school of mysticism.  No, I was never so pleased as to take an ordinary object and by a little magic make it seem something other than what it was.\nIt would have taken more imagination than I had to apply that philosophy to my monotonous life.  After the morning's lessons, we were assigned tasks before our evening classes.  Mine had been to clean out the study of a recently deceased resident of the Guild, and categorize his clutter of spellbooks, charms, and incunabula.\nIt was a lonely and tedious appointment.  Magister Tendixus was an inveterate collector of worthless junk, but I was reprimanded any time I threw something away of the least possible value.  Gradually I learned enough to deliver each of his belongings to the appropriate department: potions of healing to the Magisters of Restoration, books on physical phenomena to the Magisters of Alteration, herbs and minerals to the Alchemists, and soulgems and bound items to the Enchanters.  After one delivery to the Enchanters, I was leaving with my customary lack of appreciation, when Magister Ilther called me back.\n\"Boy,\" said the portly old man, handing me back one item. \"Destroy this.\"\nIt was a small black disc covered with runes with a ring of red-orange gems like bones circling its periphery.\n\"I'm sorry, Magister,\" I stammered. \"I thought it was something you'd be interested in.\"\n\"Take it to the great flame and destroy it,\" he barked, turning his back on me. \"You never brought it here.\"\nMy interest was piqued, because I knew the only thing that would make him react in such a way.  Necromancy.  I went back to Magister Tendixus's chamber and poured through his notes, looking for any reference to the disc.  Unfortunately, most of the notes had been written in a strange code that I was powerless to decipher.  I was so fascinated by the mystery that I nearly arrived late for my evening class in Enchantment, taught by Magister Ilther himself.\nFor the next several weeks, I divided my time categorizing the general debris and making my deliveries, and researching the disc.  I came to understand that my instinct was correct: the disc was a genuine necromantic artifact.  Though I couldn't understand most of the Magister's notes, I determined that he thought it to be a means of resurrecting a loved one from the grave.\nSadly, the time came when the chamber had been categorized and cleared, and I was given another assignment, assisting in the stables of the Guild's menagerie.  At least finally I was working with some of my fellow initiates and had the opportunity of meeting the common folk and nobles who came to the Guild on various errands.  Thus was I employed when we were all invited to the Tales and Tallows ball.\nIf the expected glamour of the evening were not enough, our hostess was reputed to be young, rich, unmarried orphan from Hammerfell.  Only a month or two before had she moved to our desolate, wooded corner of the Imperial Province to reclaim an old family manorhouse and grounds.  The initiates at the Guild gossiped like old women about the mysterious young lady's past, what had happened to her parents, why she had left or been driven from her homeland.  Her name was Betaniqi, and that was all we knew.\nWe wore our robes of initiation with pride as we arrived for the ball.  At the enormous marble foyer, a servant announced each of our names as if we were royalty, and we strutted into the midst of the revelers with great puffery.  Of course, we were then promptly ignored by one and all.  In essence, we were unimportant figures to lend some thickness to the ball.  Background characters.\nThe important people pushed through us with perfect politeness.  There was old Lady Schaudirra discussing diplomatic appointments to Balmora with the Duke of Rimfarlin.  An orc warlord entertained a giggling princess with tales of rape and pillage.  Three of the Guild Magisters worried with three painfully thin noble spinsters about the haunting of Daggerfall.  Intrigues at the Imperial and various royal courts were analyzed, gently mocked, fretted over, toasted, dismissed, evaluated, mitigated, admonished, subverted.  No one looked our way even when we were right next to them.  It was as if my skill at illusion had somehow rendered us all invisible.\nI took my flagon out to the terrace.  The moons were doubled, equally luminous in the sky and in the enormous reflecting pool that stretched out into the garden.  The white marble statuary lining the sides of the pool caught the fiery glow and seemed to burn like torches in the night.  The sight was so otherworldly that I was mesmerized by it, and the strange Redguard figures immortalized in stone.  Our hostess had made her home there so recently that some of the sculptures were still wrapped in sheets that billowed and swayed in the gentle breeze.  I don't know how long I stared before I realized I wasn't alone.\nShe was so small and so dark, not only in her skin but in her clothing, that I nearly took her for a shadow.  When she turned to me, I saw that she was very beautiful and young, not more than seventeen.\n\"Are you our hostess?\" I finally asked.\n\"Yes,\" she smiled, blushing. \"But I'm ashamed to admit that I'm very bad at it.  I should be inside with my new neighbors, but I think we have very little in common.\"\n\"It's been made abundantly clear that they hope I have nothing in common with them either,\" I laughed.  \"When I'm a little higher than an initiate in the Mages Guild, they might see me as more of an equal.\"\n\"I don't understand the concept of equality in Cyrodiil yet,\" she frowned. \"In my culture, you proved your worth, not just expected it.  My parents both were great warriors, as I hope to be.\"\nHer eyes went out to the lawn, to the statues.\n\"Do the sculptures represent your parents?\"\n\"That's my father Pariom there,\" she said gesturing to a life-sized representation of a massively built man, unashamedly naked, gripping another warrior by the throat and preparing to decapitate him with an outstretched blade.  It was clearly a realistic depiction.  Pariom's face was plain, even slightly ugly with a low forehead, a mass of tangled hair, stubble on his cheeks.  Even a slight gap in his teeth, which no sculptor would surely have invented except to do justice to his model's true idiosyncrasies.\n\"And your mother?\" I asked, pointing to a nearby statue of a proud, rather squat warrior woman in a mantilla and scarf, holding a child.\n\"Oh no,\" she laughed. \"That was my uncle's old nurse.  Mother's statue still has a sheet over it.\"\nI don't know what prompted me to insist that we unveil the statue that she pointed to.  In all likelihood, it was nothing but fate, and a selfish desire to continue the conversation.   I was afraid that if I did not give her a project, she would feel the need to return to the party, and I would be alone again.  At first she was reluctant.  She had not yet made up her mind whether the statues would suffer in the wet, sometimes cold Cyrodilic climate.  Perhaps all should be covered, she reasoned.  It may be that she was merely making conversation, and was reluctant as I was to end the stand-off and be that much closer to having to return to the party.\nIn a few minutes time, we tore the tarp from the statue of Betaniqi's mother.  That is when my life changed forevermore.\nShe was an untamed spirit of nature, screaming in a struggle with a misshapen monstrous figure in black marble.  Her gorgeous, long fingers were raking across the creature's face.  The monster's talons gripped her right breast in a sort of caress that prefaces a mortal wound.  Its legs and hers wound around one another in a battle that was a dance.  I felt annihilated.  This lithe but formidable woman was beautiful beyond all superficial standards.  Whoever had sculpted it had somehow captured not only a face and figure of a goddess, but her power and will.  She was both tragic and triumphant.  I fell instantly and fatally in love with her.\nI had not even noticed when Gelyn, one of my fellow initiates who was leaving the party, came up behind us.  Apparently I had whispered the word \"magnificent,\" because I heard Betaniqi reply as if miles away, \"Yes, it is magnificent.  That's why I was afraid of exposing it to the elements.\"\nThen I heard, clearly, like a stone breaking water, Gelyn: \"Mara preserve me.  That must be Palla.\"\n\"Then you heard of my mother?\" asked Betaniqi, turning his way.\n\"I hail from Wayrest, practically on the border to Hammerfell.  I don't think there's anyone who hasn't heard of your mother and her great heroism, ridding the land of that abominable beast.  She died in that struggle, didn't she?\"\n\"Yes,\" said the girl sadly. \"But so too did the creature.\"\nFor a moment, we were all silent.  I don't remember anything more of that night.  Somehow I knew I was invited to dine the next evening, but my mind and heart had been entirely and forever more arrested by the statue.  I returned back to the Guild, but my dreams were fevered and brought me no rest.  Everything seemed diffused by white light, except for one beautiful, fearsome woman.\nPalla.\nPalla, Volume 2\nPalla\nBook II\n\nby\nVojne Mierstyyd\nPalla.  Pal La.  The name burned in my heart.  I found myself whispering it in my studies even when I tried to concentrate on something the Magister was saying.  My lips would silently purse to voice the \"Pal,\" and tongue lightly flick to form the \"La\" as if I were kissing her spirit before me.  It was madness in every way except that I knew that it was madness.  I knew I was in love.  I knew she was a noble Redguard woman, a fierce warrior more beautiful than the stars.  I knew her young daughter Betaniqi had taken possession of a manorhouse near the Guild, and that she liked me, perhaps was even infatuated.  I knew Palla had fought a terrible beast and killed it.  I knew Palla was dead.\nAs I say, I knew it was madness, and by that, I knew I could not be mad.  But I also knew that I must return to Betaniqi's palace to see her statue of my beloved Palla engaged in that final, horrible, fatal battle with the monster.\nReturn I did, over and over again.  Had Betaniqi been a different sort of noblewoman, more comfortable with her peers, I would not have had so many opportunities.  In her innocence, unaware of my sick obsession, she welcomed my company.  We would talk for hours, laughing, and every time we would take a walk to the reflecting pond where I would always stop breathless before the sculpture of her mother.\n\"It's a marvelous tradition you have, preserving these figures of your ancestors at their finest moments,\" I said, feeling her curious eyes on me. \"And the craftsmanship is without parallel.\"\n\"You wouldn't believe me,\" laughed the girl. \"But it was a bit of scandal when my great grandfather began the custom.  We Redguards hold a great reverence for our families, but we are warriors, not artists.  He hired an traveling artist to create the first statues, and everyone admired them until it was revealed that the artist was an elf.  An Altmer from the Summurset Isle.\"\n\"Scandal!\"\n\"It was, absolutely,\" Betaniqi nodded seriously. \"The idea that a pompous, wicked elf's hands had formed these figures of noble Redguard warriors was unthinkable, profane, irreverent, everything bad you can imagine.  But my great grandfather's heart was in the beauty of it, and his philosophy of using the best to honor the best passed down to us all.  I would not have even considered having a lesser artist create the statues of my parents, even if it would have been more allegiant to my culture.\"\n\"They're all exquisite,\" I said.\n\"But you like the one of my mother most of all,\" she smiled. \"I see you look at it even when you seem to be looking at the others.  It's my favorite also.\"\n\"Would you tell me more about her?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice light and conversational.\n\"Oh, she would have said she was nothing extraordinary, but she was,\" the girl said, picking a flower from the garden. \"My father died when I was quite young, and she had so many roles to fill, but she did them all effortlessly.  We have a great many business interests and she was brilliant at managing everything.  Certainly better than I am now.  All it took was her smile and everyone obeyed, and those that didn't paid dearly.  She was very witty and charming, but a formidable force when the need arose for her to fight.  Hundreds of battles, but I can never remember a moment of feeling neglected or unloved.  I literally thought she was too strong for death.   Stupid, I know, but when she went to battle that -- that horrible creature, that freak from a mad wizard's laboratory, I never even thought she would not return.  She was kind to her friends and ruthless to her enemies.  What more can one say about a woman than that?\"\nPoor Betaniqi's eyes teared up with remembrance.  What sort of villain was I to goad her so, in order to satisfy my perverted longings?  Sheogorath could never have conflicted a mortal man more than me.  I found myself both weeping and filled with desire.  Palla not only looked like a goddess, but from her daughter's story, she was one.\nThat night while undressing for bed, I rediscovered the black disc I had stolen from Magister Tendixus's office weeks before.  I had half-forgotten about its existence, that mysterious necromantic artifact which the mage believed could resurrect a dead love.  Almost by pure instinct, I found myself placing the disc on my heart and whispering, \"Palla.\"\nA momentary chill filled my chamber.  My breath hung in the air in a mist before dissipating.  Frightened I dropped the disc.  It took a moment before my reason returned, and with it the inescapable conclusion: the artifact could fulfill my desire.\nUntil the early morning hours, I tried to raise my mistress from the chains of Oblivion, but it was no use.  I was no necromancer.  I entertained thoughts of how to ask one of the Magisters to help me, but I remembered how Magister Ilther had bid me to destroy it.  They would expel me from the Guild if I went to them and destroy the disc themselves.  And with it, my only key to bringing my love to me.\nI was in my usual semi-torpid condition the next day in classes.  Magister Ilther himself was lecturing on his specialty, the School of Enchantment.  He was a dull speaker with a monotone voice, but suddenly I felt as if every shadow had left the room and I was in a palace of light.\n\"When most persons think of my particular science, they think of the process of invention.  The infusing of charms and spells into objects.  The creation of a magickal blade, perhaps, or a ring.  But the skilled enchanter is also a catalyst.  The same mind that can create something new can also provoke greater power from something old.  A ring that can generate warmth for a novice, on the hand of such a talent can bake a forest black.\" The fat man chuckled: \"Not that I'm advocating that.  Leave that for the School of Destruction.\"\nThat week all the initiates were asked to choose a field of specialization.  All were surprised when I turned my back on my old darling, the School of Illusion.  It seemed ridiculous to me that I had ever entertained an affection for such superficial charms.  All my intellect was now focused on the School of Enchantment, the means by which I could free the power of the disc.\nFor months thereafter, I barely slept.  A few hours a week, I'd spend with Betaniqi and my statue to give myself strength and inspiration.  All the rest of my time was spent with Magister Ilther or his assistants, learning everything I could about enchantment.  They taught me how to taste the deepest levels of magicka within a stored object.\n\"A simple spell cast once, no matter how skillfully and no matter how spectacularly, is ephemeral, of the present, what it is and no more,\" sighed Magister Ilther. \"But placed in a home, it develops into an almost living energy, maturing and ripening so only its surface is touched when an unskilled hand wields it.  You must consider yourself a miner, digging deeper to pull forth the very heart of gold.\"\nEvery night when the laboratory closed, I practiced what I had learned.  I could feel my power grow and with it, the power of the disc.  Whispering \"Palla,\" I delved into the artifact, feeling every slight nick that marked the runes and every facet of the gemstones.  At times I was so close to her, I felt hands touching mine.  But something dark and bestial, the reality of death I suppose, would always break across the dawning of my dream.  With it came an overwhelming rotting odor, which the initiates in the chambers next to mine began to complain about.\n\"Something must have crawled into the floorboards and died,\" I offered lamely.\nMagister Ilther praised my scholarship, and allowed me the use of his laboratory after hours to further my studies.  Yet no matter what I learned, Palla seemed scarcely closer.  One night, it all ended.  I was swaying in a deep ecstasy, moaning her name, the disc bruising my chest, when a sudden lightning flash through the window broke my concentration.  A tempest of furious rain roared over Mir Corrup.  I went to close the shutters, and when I returned to my table, I found that the disc had shattered.\nI broke into hysterical sobs and then laughter.  It was too much for my fragile mind to bear such a loss after so much time and study.  The next day and the day after, I spent in my bed, burning with a fever.  Had I not been a Mages Guild with so many healers, I likely would have died.  As it was, I provided an excellent study for the budding young scholars.\nWhen at last I was well enough to walk, I went to visit Betaniqi.  She was charming as always, never once commenting on my appearance, which must have been ghastly.  Finally I gave her reason to worry when I politely but firmly declined to walk with her along the reflecting pool.\n\"But you love looking at the statuary,\" she exclaimed.\nI felt that I owed her the truth and much more. \"Dear lady, I love more than the statuary.  I love your mother.  She is all I've been able to think about for months now, ever since you and I first removed the tarp from that blessed sculpture.  I don't know what you think of me now, but I have been obsessed with learning how to bring her back from the dead.\"\nBetaniqi stared at me, eyes wide.  Finally she spoke: \"I think you need to leave now.  I don't know if this is a terrible jest --\"\n\"Believe me, I wish it were.  You see, I failed.  I don't know why.  It could not have been that my love wasn't strong enough, because no man had a stronger love.  Perhaps my skills as an enchanter are not masterful, but it wasn't from lack of study!\" I could feel my voice rise and knew I was beginning to rant, but I could not hold back. \"Perhaps the fault lay in that your mother never met me, but I think that only the caster's love is taken into account in the necromantic spell. I don't know what it was!  Maybe that horrible creature, the monster that killed her, cast some sort of curse on her with its dying breath!  I failed!  And I don't know why!\"\nWith a surprising burst of speed and strength for so small a lady, Betaniqi shoved herself against me.  She screamed, \"Get out!\" and I fled out the door.\nBefore she slammed the door shut, I offered my pathetic apologies: \"I'm so sorry, Betaniqi, but consider that I wanted to bring your mother back to you.  It's madness, I know, but there is only one thing that's certain in my life and that's that I love Palla.\"\nThe door was nearly shut, but the girl opened it crack to ask tremulously: \"You love whom?\"\n\"Palla!\" I cried to the Gods.\n\"My mother,\" she whispered angrily. \"Was named Xarlys.  Palla was the monster.\"\nI stared at the closed door for Mara knows how much time, and then began the long walk back to the Mages Guild.  My memory searched through the minutiae to the Tales and Tallows night so long ago when I first beheld the statue, and first heard the name of my love.  That Breton initiate, Gelyn had spoken.  He was behind me.  Was he recognizing the beast and not the lady?\nI turned the lonely bend that intersected with the outskirts of Mir Corrup, and a large shadow rose from the ground where it had been sitting, waiting for me.\n\"Palla,\" I groaned. \"Pal La.\"\n\"Kiss me,\" it howled.\nAnd that brings my story up to the present moment.  Love is red, like blood.\n"

Their underground demesnes are well suited to the moths. They raise and nurture the fragile creatures, singing to them constantly. They harvest the silk and spin it into bolts of cloth. They weave the cloth, embroidering it with the genealogies and histories of the ancestors that spun the silk. This is their new life.\nAs they tend the Ancestor Moths, so we tend the blind monks. While they toil in dark, we serve in the light. They need food and water. We provide. They need tools and furniture. We provide. They need secrecy and anonymity. We provide. They need purveyors to sell the fruit of their labors. We provide.\nAt one time, we also provided protection. Many generations ago, Gudrun came to our temple. Newly blinded by visions of what was to be, she brought with her new teachings. The visions of the ancestors foresaw the need of the monks to defend themselves. They train and practice the teachings of Gudrun constantly. They are masters of the sword of no sword, the axes of no axe.\nAs a novitiate, you will learn the teachings of Gudrun. You will learn the way of the peaceful fist. You will learn to serve the blind monks. You will learn to provide. In time, you may attain the peace and insight of the Ancestor Moths.\n"

    "text": "Experimentation in the Physicalities\n\tof the Werewolf\nby\n\tReman Crex\nFar too many books such as this one begin with some sort of justification. Some reason for study is concocted, in the hopes that the writer's obsession will be seen in a more noble light. I make no such pretensions. No werewolf killed my family, none ever threatened me personally, nor even an acquaintance of mine. My obsession is borne out of simple curiosity, with a strong dose of hatred for the unnatural. Is it possible to hate something without having been done harm by it? I am no philosopher, and thus here ends my introduction. On with my studies.\nI have endeavored, over the course of several decades, to perform a complete study of the physical nature of the creatures we call werewolves. I overlook entirely the origins of this plague, whether it is acquired voluntarily or inflicted, and how one might be cured. Such matters are filled with too much guesswork and rambling second-hand inanities from farmhands.\n\nSubject A\nCaptured: in Morrowind, while in beast form\nMakeup: Male, Breton in his true form\nNotes: Subject shows an unusually high degree of control over his transformations.\nExperiment 1 -- Subject's bodily proportions were thoroughly measured before, during, and after the transformation. As expected, the proportions were identical while in true form, but some minor swelling of the head was observed immediately after the return. Changes observed during transformation:\n23% increase in shoulder width\n\t17% narrowing of hips\n\t47% lengthening of arms\n\t7% increase in finger length (not accounting for claws)\nAs for the legs -- the lengthening of the foot to several times its normal length seems to account for the otherwise negligible changes in the thigh region.\nExperiment 2 -- Subject was coerced into changing as rapidly and as frequently as possible, at various times and at various levels of duress.\nTransformation times and effects were not viewed to change notably. Subject expired, concluding tests.\n\nSubject B\nCaptured: in Cyrodiil, already imprisoned by local authorities, in true form\nMakeup: Female, Nord in her true form\nNotes: Subject's large size in both true and transformed forms makes an excellent fit for vivisection\nI believe I may have been the first to witness a werewolf transformation ply its effects on the internal workings of a creature. The heart is the first thing to swell, long before the lungs or bones shift to accommodate it. This may account for the intense chest pains that some of the afflicted report directly before their changes.\nMore interesting were the changes observed in the muscles of the legs. I had expected a strengthening, as the beasts are known for great power and speed, but they also seemed to change color into a dusky brown. This could also be attributed to blood loss from the procedures.\nBefore the subject expired, I worked applying some known \"remedies\" for the disease directly to internal organs. Wolfsbane petals applied to the bones seemed to render them brittle, and the ribcage nearly collapsed at the touch. The juice of ripened belladonna berries was pressed directly into the veins, and they could be seen to shrivel behind the flow as it moved through the system. Upon reaching the heart, the major vessels pulled away completely, and subject expired within minutes."

    "text": "The writing in the book appears to be a hasty transcription, perhaps from dictation, or copied from a longer work.\nLet no man say before a witness that the Hunt has not been called, nor the Rites declared, or the Ancient Offices observed.\nThe Ritual of the Innocent Quarry, also called the Wild Hunt, is an ancient rite drawing magical energy from the powerful magicka stream that engulfs this realm. The creators and times of the rituals are long forgotten. But followed properly, the rite brings great power and prestige to the Huntsman.\nThe ritual pits the all-powerful Huntsmen and their Greater and Lesser Dogs against the pitiful and doomed Innocent Quarry, called by tradition the Hare, after the mortal creature of human hunts. At once, the Huntsman is transported by the exquisite thrill and glory of his might and dominion over his helpless prey, and at the same time touched by the tragic, noble, and ultimately futile plight of the Innocent Quarry. In the highest aesthetic realization of the ritual, the ecstatic rapture of the kill is balanced by the Huntsman's identification with the sadness and despair of the Innocent Quarry. As in pieces the body of the innocent Hare is torn, the Huntsman reflects on the tragic imbalances of power and the cruel injustices of the world.\nAs the Hunt begins, the Lesser Dogs assemble before the green crystal reflections of the Chapel of the Innocent Quarry. Inside the Chapel, the Huntsmen, the Greater Dogs, and the Master of the Hunt perform the rites that initiate and sanctify the Huntsmen, the Hunt, and the Innocent Quarry. Then the Huntsman emerges from the Chapel, displays the Spear of Bitter Mercy, and recites the Offices of the Hunt. The Offices describe explains the laws and conditions of the four stages of the Hunt: the Drag, the Chase, the Call, and the View to the Kill.\nStage One -- The Drag, in which the Lesser Dogs drag the ground to flush out the Hare.\nStage Two -- The Chase, in which the Greater Hounds drive the Hare before them.\nStage Three -- The Call, in which the Greater Hounds trap the Hare and summon the Huntsmen for the kill.\nStage Four -- The View, in which the Huntsman makes the kill with the ritual Spear of Bitter Mercy, and calls upon the Master of the Hunt to view the kill by ringing the town bell. The Master of the Hunt then bestows the Bounty upon the Huntsman Bold who has wielded the Spear of Bitter Mercy in the kill. The Master of the Hunt also calls upon the Huntsman Bold to name the next Hare for the next Hunt (though the Huntsman Bold himself may not participate in the next Hunt).\nThe Offices of the Hunt, which the Huntsmen, Master, and Hounds are solemnly sworn to honor, detail the practices and conditions of the Hunt. These practices and conditions, also known as the Law, strictly define all details of the Hunt, such as how many Hounds of each sort may participate, how the Spear of Bitter Mercy may be wielded, and so forth. In addition, the Law states that the Hare must have a genuine chance to escape the Hunt, no matter how slim. In practice, this condition has been defined as the availability of six keys, which, if gathered together in the Temple of Daedric Rites, permit the Hare to teleport away from the Hunt, and so elude the Huntsman and his Spear. It is inconceivable, of course, that the Hare might actually discover the keys and escape, but the forms must be observed, and tampering with the keys or cheating the Hare of a genuine chance of finding or using the keys is a shameful and unforgivable betrayal of the Law of the Hunt.\nThe Ritual of the Hunt grants the Huntsmen protection from all forms of attack, including mortal and immortal weapons, and sorceries of all schools. Huntsmen are cautioned, however, that the ritual does not protect the Huntsman from the potent energies of his own Spear, and cautions against reckless wielding of the Spear in close melee, darkness, or other dangerous circumstances, for a single touch of the Spear of Bitter Mercy means instant and certain death for innocent Hare or fellow Huntsman alike.\nThe right to name a Wild Hunt is a grand and grave right indeed, as all but the High Daedra Lords are vulnerable to the potent sorceries of the Spear of Bitter Mercy. The Spear itself is therefore a terrible weapon, and it is forbidden to remove it from the Grounds of the Ritual Hunt."

    "text": "Remanada, Chapter 1: Sancre Tor and the Birth of Reman\nAnd in those days the empire of the Cyrodiils was dead, save in memory only, for through war and slug famine and iniquitous rulers, the west split from the east and Colovia's estrangment lasted some four hundreds of years. And the earth was sick with this sundering. Once-worthy western kings, of Anvil and Sarchal, of Falkreath and Delodiil, became through pride and habit as like thief-barons and forgot covenant. In the heartland things were no better, as arcanists and false moth-princes lay in drugged stupor or the studies of vileness and no one sat on the Throne in dusted generations. Snakes and the warnings of snakes went unheeded and the land bled with ghosts and deepset holes unto cold harbors. It is said that even the Chim-el Adabal, the amulet of the kings of glory, had been lost and its people saw no reason to find it.\nAnd it was in this darkness that King Hrol set out from the lands beyond lost Twil with a sortie of questing knights numbered eighteen less one, all of them western sons and daughters. For Hrol had seen in his visions the snakes to come and sought to heal all the borders of his forebears. And to this host appeared at last a spirit who resembled none other than El-Estia, queen of ancienttimes, who bore in her left hand the dragonfire of the aka-tosh and in her right hand the jewels of the covenant and on her breast a wound that spilt void onto her mangled feet. And seeing El-Estia and Chim-el Adabal, Hrol and his knights wailed and set to their knees and prayed for all things to become as right. Unto them the spirit said, I am the healer of all men and the mother of dragons, but as you have run so many times from me so shall I run until you learn my pain, which renders you and all this land dead.\nAnd the spirit fled from them, and they split among hills and forests to find her, all grieving that they had become a villainous people. Hrol and his shieldthane were the only ones to find her, and the king spoke to her, saying, I love you sweet Aless, sweet wife of Shor and of Auri-el and the Sacred Bull, and would render this land alive again, not through pain but through a return to the dragon-fires of covenant, to join east and west and throw off all ruin. And the shieldthane bore witness to the spirit opening naked to his king, carving on a nearby rock the words AND HROL DID LOVE UNTO A HILLOCK before dying in the sight of their union.\nWhen the fifteen other knights found King Hrol, they saw him dead after his labors against a mound of mud. And they parted each in their way, and some went mad, and the two that returned to their homeland beyond Twil would say nothing of Hrol, and acted ashamed for him.\nBut after nine months that mound of mud became as a small mountain, and there were whispers among the shepherds and bulls. A small community of believers gathered around that growing hill during the days of its first churning, and they were the first to name it the Golden Hill, Sancre Tor. And it was the shepherdess Sed-Yenna who dared climb the hill when she heard his first cry, and at its peak she saw what it had yielded, an infant she named Reman, which is \"Light of Man.\"\nAnd in the child's forehead was the Chim-el Adabal, alive with the dragon-fires of yore and divine promise, and none dared obstruct Sed-Yenna when she climbed the steps of White-Gold Tower to place the babe Reman on his Throne, where he spoke as an adult, saying I AM CYRODIIL COME.\nRemanada, Chapter 2: The Chevalier Renald, Blade of the Pig\nAnd in the days of interregnum, the Chim-el Adabal was lost again amid the petty wars of gone-heathen kings. West and east knew no union then and all the lands outside of them saw Cyrodiil as a nest of snakemen and snakes. And for four more hundreds of years did the seat of Reman stay sundered, with only the machinations of a group of loyal knights keeping all its borders from throwing wide.\nThese loyal knights did go by no name then, but were known by their eastern swords and painted eyes, and it was whispered that they were descended from the bodyguard of old Reman. One of their number, called the Chevalier Renald, discovered the prowess of Cuhlecain and then supported him towards the throne. Only later would it be revealed that Renald did this thing to come closer to Talos, anon Stormcrown, the glorious yet-emperor Tiber Septim; only later still, that he was under instruction by a pig.\nLong glory was wife to the all the knights of the dragon-banner, who knew no other and were brothers before beyond many seas and now were brothers under the law named the blade-surrender of Pale Pass. And having vampire blood these brother-knights lived for ages through and past Reman and then kept guard over his ward, the coiled king, Versidue-Shaie. The snake-captain Vershu became Renald became the protector of the northern west when the black dart was hooked into Savirien-Chorak.\n[Here torn pages indicate that the rest of this ancient book has been lost.]"

    "description": "The story of Uriel V's failed invasion of Akavir.",
    "text": "Report of the Imperial\nCommission on the\n\tDisaster at Ionith\nby\n\tLord Pottreid, Chairman\nPart I: Preparations\nThe Emperor's plans for the invasion of Akavir were laid in the 270s, when he began the conquest of the small island kingdoms that lie between Tamriel and Akavir. With the fall of Black Harbor in Esroniet in 282, Uriel V was already looking ahead to the ultimate prize. He immediately ordered extensive renovations to the port, which would serve as the marshalling point for the invasion force and as the main supply source throughout the campaign. At this time he also began the construction of the many large, ocean-going transports that would be needed for the final crossing to Akavir, in which the Navy was previously deficient. Thus it can be seen that the Emperor's preparations for the invasion were laid well in advance, before even the conquest of Esroniet was complete, and was not a sudden whim as some have charged.\nWhen Prince Bashomon yielded Esroniet to Imperial authority in 284, the Emperor's full attention could be devoted to planning for the Akaviri campaign. Naval expeditions were dispatched in 285 and 286 to scout the sea lanes and coastlands of Akavir; and various Imperial intelligence agents, both magical and mundane, were employed to gather information. On the basis of all this information, the kingdom of the Tsaesci, in the southwest of Akavir, was selected as the initial target for the invasion.\nMeanwhile the Emperor was gathering his Expeditionary Force. A new Far East Fleet was created for the campaign, which for a time dwarfed the rest of the Navy; it is said to be the most powerful fleet ever assembled in the history of Tamriel. The Fifth, Seventh, Tenth, and Fourteenth Legions were selected for the initial landing, with the Ninth and Seventeenth to follow as reinforcements once the beachhead was secured. While this may seem to the layman a relatively small fraction of the Army's total manpower, it must be remembered that this Expeditionary Force would have to be maintained at the end of a long and tenuous supply line; in addition, the Emperor and the Army command believed that the invasion would not be strongly opposed, at least at first. Perhaps most crucially, the Navy had only enough heavy transport capacity to move four legions at a time.\nIt should be noted here that the Commission does not find fault with the Emperor's preparations for the invasion. Based on the information available prior to the invasion, (which, while obviously deficient in hindsight, great effort had been made to accumulate), the Commission believes that the Emperor did not act recklessly or imprudently. Some have argued that the Expeditionary Force was too small. The Commission believes that on the contrary, even if shipping could have been found to transport and supply more legions (an impossibility without crippling the trade of the entire Empire), this would have merely added to the scale of the disaster; it would not have averted it. Neither could the rest of the Empire be denuded of legions; the memory of the Camoran Usurper was still fresh, and the Emperor believed (and this Commission agrees) that the security of the Empire precluded a larger concentration of military force outside of Tamriel. If anything, the Commission believes that the Expeditionary Force was too large. Despite the creation of two new legions during his reign (and the recreation of the Fifth), the loss of the Expeditionary Force left the Empire in a dangerously weak position relative to the provinces, as the current situation makes all too clear. This suggests that the invasion of Akavir was beyond the Empire's current strength; even if the Emperor could have fielded and maintained a larger force in Akavir, the Empire may have disintegrated behind him.\nPart II: The Invasion of Akavir\nThe Expeditionary Force left Black Harbor on 23rd Rain's Hand, 288, and with fair weather landed in Akavir after six weeks at sea. The landing site was a small Tsaesci port at the mouth of a large river, chosen for its proximity to Tamriel as well as its location in a fertile river valley, giving easy access to the interior as well as good foraging for the army. All went well at first. The Tsaesci had abandoned the town when the Expeditionary Force approached, so they took possession of it and renamed it Septimia, the first colony of the new Imperial Province of Akavir. While the engineers fortified the town and expanded the port facilities to serve the Far East Fleet, the Emperor marched inland with two legions. The surrounding land was reported to be rich, well-watered fields, and meeting no resistance the army took the next city upriver, also abandoned. This was refounded as Ionith, and the Emperor established his headquarters there, being much larger than Septimia and better-located to dominate the surrounding countryside.\nThe Expeditionary Force had yet to meet any real resistance, although the legions were constantly shadowed by mounted enemy patrols which prevented any but large scouting parties from leaving the main body of the army. One thing the Emperor sorely lacked was cavalry, due to the limited space on the transport fleet, although for the time being the battlemages made up for this with magical reconnaissance.\nThe Emperor now sent out envoys to try to contact the Tsaesci king or whoever ruled this land, but his messengers never returned. In retrospect, the Commission believes that valuable time was wasted in this effort while the army was stalled at Ionith, which could have been better spent in advancing quickly while the enemy was still, apparently, surprised by the invasion. However, the Emperor believed at the time that the Tsaesci could be overawed by the Empire's power and he might win a province by negotiation with no need for serious fighting.\nMeanwhile, the four legions were busy building a road between Septimia and Ionith, setting up fortified guard posts along the river, and fortifying both cities' defences, activities which would serve them well later. Due to their lack of cavalry, scouting was limited, and communication between the two cities constantly threatened by enemy raiders, with which the legions were still unable to come to grips.\nThe original plan had been to bring the two reinforcing legions across as soon as the initial landing had secured a port, but the fateful decision was now taken to delay their arrival and instead begin using the Fleet to transport colonists. The Emperor and the Council agreed that, due to the complete abandonment of the conquered area by its native population, colonists were needed to work the fields so that the Expeditionary Force would not have to rely entirely on the fleet for supplies. In addition, unrest had broken out in Yneslea, athwart the supply route to Akavir, and the Council believed the Ninth and Seventeenth legions would be better used in repacifying those territories and securing the Expeditionary Force's supply lines.\nThe civilian colonists and their supplies began arriving in Septimia in mid-Hearthfire, and they took over the preparation of the fields (which had been started by the legionnaires) for a spring crop. A number of cavalry mounts were also brought over at this time, and the raids on the two Imperial colonies subsequently fell off. Tsaesci emissaries also finally arrived in Ionith, purportedly to begin peace negotiations, and the Expeditionary Force settled in for what was expected to be a quiet winter.\nAt this time, the Council urged the Emperor to return to Tamriel with the Fleet, to deal with many pressing matters of the Empire while the army was in winter quarters, but the Emperor decided that it would be best to remain in Akavir. This turned out to be fortunate, because a large portion of the Fleet, including the Emperor's flagship, was destroyed by an early winter storm during the homeward voyage. The winter storm season of 288-289 was unusually prolonged and exceptionally severe, and prevented the Fleet from returning to Akavir as planned with additional supplies. This was reported to the Emperor via battlemage and it was agreed that the Expeditionary Force could survive on what supplies it had on hand until the spring.\n\nPart III: The Destruction of the Expeditionary Force\nThe winter weather in Akavir was also much more severe than expected. Due to the supply problems and the addition of thousands of civilians, the Expeditionary Force was on tight rations. To make matters worse, the Tsaesci raiders returned in force and harried any foraging and scouting parties outside the walls of the two cities. Several watch forts on the road between Septimia and Ionith were captured during blizzards, and the rest had to be abandoned as untenable. As a result, communication between the two cities had to be conducted entirely by magical means, a continuing strain on the legions' battlemages.\nOn 5th Sun's Dawn, a large entourage of Tsaesci arrived at Ionith claiming to bring a peace offer from the Tsaesci king. That night, these treacherous envoys murdered the guards at one of the city gates and let in a strong party of their comrades who were waiting outside the city walls. Their clear intention was to assassinate the Emperor, foiled only by the vigilance and courage of troopers of the Tenth who were guarding his palace. Once the alarm was raised, the Tsaesci inside the city were hunted down and killed to the last man. Needless to say, this was the end of negotiations between the Emperor and the Tsaesci.\nThe arrival of spring only brought worse troubles. Instead of the expected spring rains, a hot dry wind began to blow from the east, continuing with varying strength through the entire summer. The crops failed, and even the river (which in the previous year had been navigable by small boats far upstream of Ionith) was completely dried up by Sun's Height. It is unknown if this was due to a previously unknown weather pattern unique to Akavir, or if the Tsaesci manipulated the weather through magical means. The Commission leans towards the former conclusion, as there is no direct evidence of the Tsaesci possessing such fearsome arcane power, but the latter possibility cannot be entirely ruled out.\nDue to prolonged bad weather, the supply fleet was late in setting out from Black Harbor. It finally left port in early Second Seed, but was again severely mauled by storms and limped into Septimia eight weeks later much reduced. Because of the increasingly desperate supply situation in Akavir, the Emperor dispatched most of his Battlemage Corps with the fleet to assist it in weathering the storms which seemed likely to continue all summer. At this time, the Council urged the Emperor to abandon the invasion and to return to Tamriel with the Expeditionary Force, but he again refused, noting that the fleet was no longer large enough to transport all four legions at once. The Commission agrees that leaving one or more legions behind in Akavir to await the return of the fleet would have damaged Army morale. But the Commission also notes that the loss of one legion would have been preferable to the loss of the entire Expeditionary Force. It is the unanimous opinion of the Commission that this was the last point at which complete disaster might have been averted. Once the decision was made to send the fleet back for reinforcements and supplies, events proceeded to their inevitable conclusion.\nFrom this point on, much less is known about what transpired in Akavir. With most of the battlemages assisting the fleet, communication between the Expeditionary Force and Tamriel was limited, especially as the situation in Akavir worsened and the remaining battlemages had their powers stretched to the limit attending to all the needs of the legions. However, it appears that the Tsaesci may also have been actively interfering with the mages in some unknown manner. Some of the mages in Akavir reported their powers being abnormally weak, and the mages of the War College in Cyrodiil (who were handling communications for the Council) reported problems linking up with their compatriots in Akavir, even between master and pupil of long training. The Commission urges that the War College make a particular study of the arcane powers of the Tsaesci, should the Empire ever come into conflict with Akavir again.\nWhat is known is that the Emperor marched out of Ionith in mid-Sun's Height, leaving only small garrisons to hold the cities. He had learned that the Tsaesci were massing their forces on the other side of a mountain range to the north, and he intended to smash their army before it could gather full strength and capture their supplies (of which he was in desperate need). This rapid advance seems to have taken the Tsaesci by surprise, and the Expeditionary Force crossed the mountains and fell on their camp, routing the Tsaesci army and capturing its leader (a noble of some kind). But the Emperor was soon forced to retreat, and the legions suffered heavily on their retreat to Ionith. The Emperor now found himself besieged in Ionith, cut off from the small garrison at Septimia which was also besieged. By this time, it seems that the efforts of the few remaining battlemages were devoted entirely to creating water to keep the army alive, a skill not normally emphasized at the War College. The fleet had arrived safely back to Black Harbor, thanks to the Battlemage Corps, but all attempts to return to Akavir were frustrated by a series of ever more savage storms that battered Esroniet throughout the rest of 289.\nThe Council's last contact with the Emperor was in early Frostfall. By Evening Star, the Council was extremely worried about the situation in Akavir and ordered the fleet to sail regardless of the risk. Despite the continued storms, the fleet managed to press on to Akavir. Hope was raised when contact was made with the Emperor's battlemage, who reported that Ionith still held out. Plans were quickly laid for the Expeditionary Force to break out of Ionith and fall back on Septimia, where the fleet would meet them. This was the last direct contact with the Expeditionary Force. The fleet arrived in Septimia to find its garrison under savage assault from a large Tsaesci army. The battlemages with the fleet threw back the enemy long enough for the survivors to embark and the fleet to withdraw.\nThe few survivors of the Expeditionary Force who reached Septimia told how the Emperor had led the army out of Ionith by night two days earlier, succesfully breaking through the enemy lines but then being surrounded by overwhelming forces on the road to Septimia. They told of a heroic last stand by the Emperor and the Tenth Legion, which allowed a remnant of the Fourteenth to reach Septimia. Two survivors of the Tenth arrived in Septimia that night, having slipped through the enemy lines during their undisciplined victory celebration. These men confirmed having seen the Emperor die, cut down by enemy arrows as he rallied the Tenth's shield wall.\nPart IV: Conclusion\nThe Commission believes that the invasion of Akavir was doomed from the start for several reasons, none of which could have been foreseen beforehand, unfortunately.\nDespite extensive intelligence-gathering, the Expeditionary Force was clearly unprepared for the situation in Akavir. The unexpected weather which plagued the army and navy was particularly disastrous. Without the loss of a majority of the Far East Fleet during the campaign, the Expeditionary Force could have been withdrawn in 289. The weather also forced the Emperor to assign most of his Battlemage Corps to the fleet, leaving him without their valuable assistance during the fighting which soon followed. And of course the unexpected drought which struck Ionith during 289 dashed the hopes of supplying the army locally, and left the Expeditionary Force in an untenable situation when besieged in Ionith.\nThe Tsaesci were also much stronger than intelligence reports had suggested. Information on the size of the army the Tsaesci were eventually able to field against the Expeditionary Force is vague, as the only serious fighting took place after regular communications were cut off between the Emperor and the Council. Nevertheless, it seems likely that the Tsaesci outnumbered the Emperor's forces by several times, as they were able to force four crack legions into retreat and then keep them under siege for several months.\nAs was stated previously, the Commission declines to criticize the initial decision to invade Akavir. Based on what was known at the time, the plan seemed sound. It is only with the benefit of hindsight does it become obvious that the invasion had very little chance of success. Nevertheless, the Commission believes several valuable lessons can be taken from this disaster.\nFirst, the Tsaesci may have extremely powerful arcane forces at their command. The possibility that they may have manipulated the weather across such a vast region seems incredible (and it should be noted that three Commissioners strongly objected to this paragraph even being included in this Report), but the Commission believes that this matter deserves urgent investigation. The potential danger is such that even the slight possibility must be taken seriously.\nSecond, the Tsaesci appear to possess no navy to speak of. The Expeditionary Force was never threatened by sea, and the Far East Fleet fought nothing but the weather. Indeed, initial plans called for a portion of the Fleet to remain in Akavir for use in coastal operations, but in the event there were very few places where the large vessels of the Fleet could approach the land, due to the innumerable reefs, sandbars, islands, etc. that infested the coastal waters north and south from Septimia. Due to the utter lack of trees in the plain around Septimia and Ionith, the Expeditionary Force was unable to build smaller vessels which could have navigated the shallow coastal waters. Any future military expeditions against Akavir would do well to consider some way of bringing a means for inshore naval operations in order to exploit this clear advantage over the Tsaesci, an advantage that was sadly unexploited by the Expeditionary Force.\nThird, much longer-term study needs to be made of Akavir before another invasion could even be contemplated. The information gathered over the four years prior to the invasion was extensive, but clearly inadequate. The weather conditions were completely unexpected; the Tsaesci much stronger than expected; and the attempted negotiations by the Emperor with the Tsaesci a disaster. Akavir proved alien beyond expectation, and the Commission believes any future attempt to invade Akavir should not be contemplated without much greater knowledge of the conditions, politics, and peoples of that continent than presently obtains.\nFinally, the Commission unanimously concludes that given what we now know, any attempt to invade Akavir is folly, at least in the present state of the Empire. The Empire's legions are needed at home. One day, a peaceful, united Empire will return to Akavir and exact severe retribution for the disaster at Ionith and for our fallen Emperor. But that day is not now, nor in the foreseeable future."

    "text": "The following is the account of Lathenil of Sunhold, an Altmer refugee from Summerset Isle who came to Cyrodiil in the early years of the Fourth Era. According to Lathenil, he did not flee the aftermath of the Oblivion Crisis in Summerset - rather he fled \"the darkening shadow of the Thalmor upon my beloved homeland.\"\nLathenil had a very intense presence, to put it politely, and some of his accusations of Thalmor involvement border on madness. This may be why his fervent warnings and outspoken criticisms of the Thalmor and the Aldmeri Dominion went unheeded, but history has at least partially vindicated Lathenil's claims.\nPraxis Erratuim, Imperial Historian\nRising Threat, Vol. I\nI was barely more than a child when the Great Anguish fell upon us. The very air was torn asunder, leaving gaping, infected wounds that spewed daedra from the bowels of Oblivion. Many flocked to the shores, seeking escape from Dagon's murderous host - but the seas betrayed our people, raising up to smash our ships and our ports, leaving us to fates so vile and wicked that death would seem a mercy.\nThe Crystal Tower stood as our last bastion of hope, in both the literal and figurative sense.\nRefugees filled the Crystal Tower until it could hold no more. I could taste the fear hanging in the air; feel the pall of despair suffocating us. We could see the daedra moving through the trees in the distance, but they did not come. Days passed, and still the daedra would not approach within arrow-shot of the battlements. Hope began to grow. \"They fear us,\" some would say, \"even a daedra knows not to trifle with the wisdom and magicks of the Crystal-Like-Law!\"\nIt was as if the foul denizens of Oblivion had been waiting for this very spirit to stoke our hearts before they acted.\nAs we slept, innumerable legions of daedra amassed around us... and they were not alone. Hundreds of Altmer prisoners were gathered with them. As dawn broke, we were awoken by their screams as the daedra began to flail them and flay them. We watched in abject horror as our kinfolk were defiled completely... carved up and eaten alive, impaled on their depraved war machines, and worried apart as meals for their profane beasts.\nThis bloodletting was only a prelude to whet their appetites.\nOnce the daedra finished with our kinfolk, they turned their eyes to the Crystal Tower. Our great and noble bastion proved as much of an impediment as a mighty oak to a landslide - standing tall for but a few moments, appearing almost able to ride the tide of destruction around it, but ultimately being swept away.\nOur exalted wizards decimated the fiends, roasting them by the dozens. Archers were finding the narrowest of chinks in their daedric armor at over a hundred paces, felling their captains and commanders. The might and skillfulness of our heroic defenders was astonishing to behold, but it was not enough. The daedra clambered over the corpses of their cohort. They marched headlong into death and destruction that would make the mightiest armies in all of Tamriel quake with fear.\nWhen they breached the walls, I fled along with the other cowards. I take no pride in that act. It has haunted my existence ever since, and I burn with shame to admit it, but it is truth. We fled in mindless panic - abandoning those stalwart Altmer who held the line against the onslaught, to preserve and defend our illustrious Crystal Tower.\nWe raced through cleverly concealed passageways and emerged well away from the chaos that had descended upon the tower. That is when it happened. It started like a gust rustling through the leaves of a dense forest, but the sound did not taper off. It rose into a roar as the very ground on which I stood began to shudder. I turned to look, and the world held its breath...\nI stood transfixed as the heart of my homeland was torn as if from my own breast. The unthinkable, the incomprehensible... the tower of Crystal-Like-Law cast to the ground, with all the dignity of a beggar meeting an iron-clad fist. An eternity I watched, trying to reconcile what I knew with what I saw.\nSobs racked my chest, and weeping filled the air around me as the spell loosened its hold and I realized where I was. There were scores of other refugees mesmerized by the horror that had likewise ensorcelled me. \"Go,\" I croaked out as my heart - the heart of my land - shattered. No one moved, not even me.\nI mustered what will I could and bellowed all the fear and hatred and agony at what had just happened, turning the word into a mindless shriek: \"GO!\" I ran then, feeling more than seeing that the others had followed.\nRising Threat, Vol. II\n\nWhat happened after the tower of Crystal-like-law fell was a daze. It was as if my mind simply... stopped. Instinct took over, as my every thought sank into a black abyss of despair. Time lost all meaning, and to this day I know not how long I was in this state. Eventually a conscious thought managed to break my fugue: the daedric horde had vanished! Gone as suddenly as they had come.\nBefore my numbed mind could comprehend the tumult that consumed my beloved Summerset Isle, before I could formulate the question \"how?\" they were there, dripping honeyed poison in our ears: the Thalmor. They were the ones that saved us, they claimed, working deep and subtle magicks. It was their efforts, their sacrifices that delivered the Altmer from extinction.\nOh, what fools we were. We wanted so desperately someone to thank for ending our tribulations, we lavished it upon the first to step up and claim the glory. With that simple act of gratitude, we allowed a vile rot to seep into our homeland, to putrefy our once noble and distinguished civilization.\nIt was months before I began to suspect the error we had made. Small twinges of unease would vex me, but each one alone was easy enough to disregard and push aside. The exile of the great seer-mage Rynandor the Bold was the final doubt that I could not ignore. You see, Rynandor was one of the very few who survived the collapse of the Crystal Tower - I saw some of his bravery and heroics with my own eyes. It was his leadership and sorcery that made the daedra pay such a high price for their destruction of the Crystal Tower.\nThe Thalmor besmirched his name when he had the audacity to publicly doubt and question their role in ending the Oblivion Crisis on Summerset Isle. Rynandor made the mistake of ignoring the consensus gentium, trusting instead to logic and facts. The shrewdness of the Thalmor, however, was not such to allow something as trivial as the truth stand in their way. As soon as they shifted the collective opinion ever so slightly against Rynandor, they had him sequestered and intensified their efforts to tarnish his reputation. Unable to mount any sort of defense to the Thalmor's attacks, Rynandor was quickly denounced and exiled.\n\nRising Threat, Vol. III\n\nEver so cautiously, I formed a cabal made up of others who distrusted the motives and methods of the Thalmor. Over several months, I liquidated my ancestral holdings and took whatever inheritance I could without raising any suspicions. I would follow after Rynandor and help him restore his reputation and status. We would then return to best the Thalmor at their own game and win back the mores and morals of the Altmer! The rest of my cabal would stay on Summerset Isle and win the trust of the Thalmor on whatever level best suited each of them, sending clandestine missives to me when possible.\n\nAfter weeks of painstaking investigations and exorbitant bribes, I was able to learn that Rynandor was placed on a ship to Anvil. I booked my own passage to Anvil. My search almost ended there, for Rynandor had never arrived in Anvil Harbor. My instinct that Rynandor met a duplicitous end was confirmed when I sought out several of the deckhands who were reported to be aboard Rynandor's vessel. All died under mysterious and violent circumstances.\nThe first of many attempts on my life occurred soon after. Needless to say, I survived, but my grand plan to stymie the Thalmor fell apart without an esteemed leader to rally behind. I went into hiding, waiting anxiously for word of the Thalmor's activities back on Summerset Isle.\nOver the following years, I tried to bend the ear of the Empire through various avenues and warn them of the Thalmor's doings. The Empire, however, was having enough troubles dealing with the aftermath of the Oblivion crisis within its own borders without seeking trouble in far away Summerset. With the assassination of Emperor Uriel Septim VII and his heirs, and the self-sacrifice of Martin Septim (the true savior of Summerset Isle and the rest of Tamriel!) the Empire's leadership was left defunct.\nHigh Chancellor Ocato convened the full Elder Council in an unsuccessful bid to select a new Emperor. Without an Emperor, the Empire beyond the reach of Cyrodiil began to splinter. Ocato reluctantly agreed to become the Potentate under the terms of the Elder Council Charter until Imperial rule could be reestablished, but a reluctant leader is rarely a strong leader.\nPotentate Ocato made admirable efforts to rein in the bedlam that threatened to rip the Empire apart, and was even making headway when Red Mountain erupted and destroyed much of Vvardenfell (likely from Thalmor tampering, but I have yet to find proof of their misdeeds in this). What was left of Morrowind was thrown into absolute chaos. The effects of the eruption were felt even in Black Marsh, destroying roads and cutting off the Imperial garrisons there.\nNone were prepared for what happened next.\n\nRising Threat, Vol. IV\nWhile Morrowind and the Imperial forces in Black Marsh were still reeling from the consecutive catastrophes of the Oblivion Crisis and the destruction of Vvardenfell, the Thalmor incited the Argonians to mount a massive uprising. Black Marsh and southern Morrowind were completely lost to the Argonians, but luckily the Thalmor too lost what influence they had over the reptilians.\nAll the while, the Thalmor consolidated their hold over my beloved homeland.\nIt took almost a decade before my own machinations put me into contact with Ocato. He seemed more interested than most in what I had to say about the Thalmor, maybe because he was himself an Altmer and recognized the threat they represented. It wasn't long before the Thalmor had Ocato assassinated.\nPotentate Ocato's murder began the Stormcrown Interregnum. The Elder Council fractured, leading into years of ruthless in-fighting, plots and backstabbing. Many tried to claim the Ruby Throne. Most were pretenders to the crown, a few had legitimate claims, others still were little more than brutal dullards who thought mere strength of arms was all the entitlement they needed. Violent, unnatural storms lashed the Imperial City several times during this anarchy, always with the eye of the storm looking directly down upon White-Gold Tower, as if this was the judgment of the Nine Divines.\nWith the Empire submerged in this mayhem, the Thalmor were quick to act. They overthrew the rightful Kings and Queens of the Altmer. I remember the revulsion and horror that took hold when word reached me - that this dementia had gripped my homeland. Once so proud and majestic, many of our great race actually embraced this insanity!\nThen the first of many pogroms descended on Summerset Isle. They slaughtered any who were not \"of the blood of the Aldmer\". A fine excuse to purge the dissidents, as well - the Thalmor have never been ones to waste such an opportunity.\nAfter seven long, bloody years the Stormcrown Interregnum was ended when a Colovian warlord by the name of Titus Mede seized the crown. Whether he had rightful claim or not is moot. Without Titus Mede, there would not be an Empire today. He proved a shrewd and capable leader, such that Skyrim endorsed him as Emperor.\nWith the Empire stabilizing under the auspicious efforts Emperor Titus Mede, I resumed my efforts to warn them of the Thalmor threat. Again, the Thalmor remained a step ahead. Before my efforts could come to fruition, the Thalmor struck: another coup, this time in Valenwood. The Empire was not prepared for the Thalmor's subterfuge and stratagem.\nThere are those who claim the combined Altmer and Bosmer forces greatly out-matched the Empire, but this is a farce. This short, savage campaign was won by the Thalmor even before first blood was drawn. They waited and watched their enemy, they chose where and when they would attack. The Thalmor were able to bring the full fury of their small contingent of Altmer and Bosmer to any of several Imperial strongholds.\nContrary to the posturing of the Empire's generals, the Thalmor did not command greater numbers. They had better spies and greater mobility, and knew how best to use them. This is the menace that the Thalmor represent! They are cruel and merciless, but they are no fools! They are devious and subtle, and so very patient.\nIn one fell stroke, the Thalmor took a strategic foothold on the mainland of Tamriel and prevented any significant attempt the Empire could have made to invade Summerset Isle and depose the tyranny of the Thalmor. At the same time, they took a better vantage to continue to watch the Empire and wait. In so doing, they also revived the Aldmeri Dominion with their alliance to the Bosmer of Valenwood!\n<br>\nOver the decades, the Thalmor have grown quiet - but this is not the end. It has only just begun. They merely consolidate their power and tighten their grip on the hearts and minds of the Altmer. The Empire may wish to forget the wounds its pride has suffered at the hands of the Thalmor, but they are still out there. Plotting. Watching. Waiting.\nWhile the Empire is content to secure inconsequential corners of its vast holdings, the threat of the Thalmor continues to rise. Not since Potentate Ocato has anyone in the Empire listened to me. I beseech any and all citizens of this renowned Empire to heed my words! The Thalmor must be stopped, before it is too late.\n***\nSoon after Lathenil of Sunhold commissioned to have these volumes printed and distributed far and wide in the Empire with his own coin, he himself met a violent end. In light of the events that followed his death, we must consider that he may very well have been murdered by Thalmor assassins.\n-- Praxis Erratuim, Imperial Historian"

    "text": "With the acclamations of the Fellows of the Imperial Society still ringing in my ears, I decided to return to Morrowind immediately. It was not without some regret that I bade farewell to the fleshpots of the Imperial City, but I knew that the wonders I had brought back from Raled-Makai had only scratched the surface of the Dwemer ruins in Morrowind. Even more spectacular treasures were out there, I felt, just waiting to be found, and I was eager to be off. I also had before me the salutary example of poor Bannerman, who was still dining out on his single expedition to Black Marsh twenty years ago. That would never be me, I vowed.\nWith my letter from the Empress in hand, this time I would have the full cooperation of the Imperial authorities. No more need to worry about attacks from superstitious locals. But where should I look next? The ruins at Kemel-Ze were the obvious choice. Unlike Raled-Makai, getting to the ruins would not be a problem. Also known as the \"Cliff City\", Kemel-Ze lies on the mainland side of the Vvardenfel Rift, sprawling down the sheer coastal cliff. Travelers from the east coast of Vvardenfel often visit the site by boat, and it can also be reached overland from the nearby villages without undue hardship.\nOnce my expedition had assembled in Seyda Neen, with the usual tedious complications involved in operating in this half-civilized land, we set out for the village of Marog near the ruins, where we hoped to hire a party of diggers. My interpreter, Tuen Panai, an unusually jolly fellow for a Dark Elf who I had hired in Seyda Neen at the recommendation of the local garrison commander, assured me that the local villagers would be very familiar with Kemel-Ze, having looted the site for generations. Incidentally, Ten Penny (as we soon came to call him, to his constant amusement) proved invaluable and I would recommend him without hesitation to any of my colleagues who were planning similar expeditions to the wilds of Morrowind.\nAt Marog, we ran into our first trouble. The hetman of the village, a reserved, elegant old fellow, seemed willing to cooperate, but the local priest (a representative of the absurd religion they have here, worshiping something called the Tribunal who they claim actually live in palaces in Morrowind) was fervently against us excavating the ruins. He looked likely to sway the villagers to his side with his talk of \"religious taboos\", but I waved the Empress's letter under his nose and mentioned something about my friend the garrison commander at Seyda Neen and he quieted right down. No doubt this was just a standard negotiating tactic arranged among the villagers to increase their pay. In any event, once the priest had stalked off muttering to himself, no doubt calling down curses upon the heads of the foreign devils, we soon had a line of villagers eager to sign on to the expedition.\nWhile my assistant was working out the mundane details of contracts, supplies, etc., Master Arum and I rode on to the ruins. By land, they can only be reached using narrow paths that wind down the face of the cliff from above, where any misstep threatens to send one tumbling into the sea foaming about the jagged rocks below. The city's original entrance to the surface must have been in the part of the city to the northeast - the part that fell into the sea long ago when the eruption of Red Mountain created this mind-bogglingly vast crater. After successfully navigating the treacherous path, we found ourselves in a large chamber, open to the sky on one side, disappearing into the darkness on the other. As we stepped forward, our boots crunched on piles of broken metal, as common in Dwarven ruins as potsherds in other ancient sites. This was obviously where the looters brought their finds from deeper levels, stripping off the valuable outer casings of the Dwarven mechanisms and leaving their innards here - easier than lugging the intact mechanisms back up to the top of the cliff. I laughed to myself, thinking of the many warriors unwittingly walking around Tamriel with pieces of Dwarven mechanisms on their backs. For that, of course, is what most \"Dwarven armor\" really is - just the armored shells of ancient mechanical men. I sobered when I thought of how exceedingly valuable an intact mechanism would be. This place was obviously full of Dwarven devices, judging from the litter covering the floor of this vast chamber - or had been, I reminded myself. Looters had been working over this site for centuries. Just the casing alone would be worth a small fortune, sold as armor. Most Dwarven armor is made of mismatched pieces from various devices, hence its reputation for being bulky and unwieldy. But a matched set from an intact mechanism is worth more than its weight in gold, for the pieces all fit together smoothly and the wearer hardly notices the bulk. Of course, I had no intention of destroying my finds for armor, no matter how valuable. I would bring it back to the Society for scientific study. I imagined the astonished cries of my colleagues as I unveiled it at my next lecture, and smiled again.\nI picked up a discarded gear from the piles at my feet. It still gleamed brightly, as if new-made, the Dwarven alloys resisting the corrosion of time. I wondered what secrets remained hidden in the maze of chambers that lay before me, defying the efforts of looters, waiting to gleam again in the light they had not seen in long eons. Waiting for me. It remained only to find them! With an impatient gesture to Master Arum to follow, I strode forward into the gloom.\nMaster Arum, Ten Penny and I spent several days exploring the ruins while my assistants set up camp at the top of the cliff and hauled supplies and equipment from the village. I was looking for a promising area to begin excavation -- a blocked passage or corridor untouched by looters that might lead to completely untouched areas of the ruins.\nWe found two such areas early on, but soon discovered that the many winding passages bypassed the blockage and gave access to the rooms behind. Nevertheless, even these outer areas, for the most part stripped clean of artifacts by generations of looters, were full of interest to the professional archaeologist. Behind a massive bronze door, burst from its hinges by some ancient turmoil of the earth, we discovered a large chamber filled with exquisite wall-carvings, which impressed even the jaded Ten Penny, who claimed to have explored every Dwarven ruin in Morrowind. They seemed to depict an ancient ritual of some kind, with a long line of classically-bearded Dwarven elders processing down the side walls, all seemingly bowing to the giant form of a god carved into the front wall of the chamber, which was caught in the act of stepping forth from the crater of a mountain in a cloud of smoke or steam. According to Master Arum, there are no known depictions of Dwarven religious rituals, so this was an exciting find indeed. I set a team to work prying the carved panels from the wall, but they were unable to even crack the surface. On closer examination the chamber appeared to be faced with a metallic substance with the texture and feel of stone, impervious to any of our tools. I considered having Master Arum try his blasting magic on the walls, but decided that the risk of destroying the carvings was too great. Much as I would have preferred to bring them back to the Imperial City, I had to settle for taking rubbings of the carvings. If my colleagues in the Society showed enough interest, I was sure a specialist could be found, perhaps a master alchemist, who could find a way to safely remove the panels.\nI found another curious room at the top of a long winding stair, barely passable due to the fall of rubble from the roof. At the top of the stair was a domed chamber with a large ruined mechanism at its center. Painted constellations were still visible in some places on the surface of the dome. Master Arum and I agreed that this must have been some kind of observatory, and the mechanism was therefore the remains of a Dwarven telescope. To remove it from ruins down the narrow stairway would require its complete disassembly (which fact no doubt had preserved it from the attention of looters), so I decided to leave it in place for the time being. The existence of this observatory suggested, however, that this room had once been above the surface. Closer examination of the structure revealed that this was indeed a building, not an excavated chamber. The only other doorways from the room were completely blocked, and careful measurements from the top of the cliff to the entry room and then to the observatory revealed that we were still more than 250 feet below the present ground level. A sobering reminder of the forgotten fury of Red Mountain.\nThis discovery led us to focus our attentions downward. Since we now knew approximately where the ancient surface lay, we could rule out many of the higher blocked passages. One wide passage, impressively flanked with carven pillars, particularly drew my interest. It ended in a massive rockfall, but we could see where looters had begun and then abandoned a tunnel through this debris. With my team of diggers and Master Arum's magery to assist, I believed we could succeed where our predecessors had failed. I therefore set my team of Dark Elves to work on clearing the passage, relieved finally to be beginning the real exploration of Kemel-Ze. Soon, I hoped, my boots would be stirring up dust that had lain undisturbed since the dawn of time.\nWith this exciting prospect before me, I may have driven my diggers a bit too hard. Ten Penny reported that they were beginning to grumble about the long days, and that some were talking of quitting. Knowing from experience that nothing puts heart back into these Dark Elves like a taste of the lash, I had the ringleaders whipped and the rest confined to the ruins until they had finished clearing the passageway. Thank Stendarr for my foresight in requisitioning a few legionnaires from Seyda Neen! They were sullen at first, but with the promise of an extra day's wages when they broke through, they soon set to work with a will. While these measures may sound harsh to my readers back in the comforts of civilization, let me assure you that there is no other way to get these people to stick to a task.\nThe blockage was much worse than I had first thought, and in the end it took almost two weeks to clear the passage. The diggers were as excited as I was when their picks finally broke through the far end into emptiness, and we shared a round of the local liquor together (a foul concoction, in truth) to show that all was forgiven. I could hardly restrain my eagerness as they enlarged the hole to allow entry into the chamber beyond. Would the passage lead to entire new levels of the ancient city, filled with artifacts left by the vanished Dwarves? Or would it be only a dead end, some side passage leading nowhere? My excitement grew as I slid through the hole and crouched for a moment in the darkness beyond. From the echoing sounds of the stones rattling beneath my feet, I was in a large room. Perhaps very large. I stood up carefully, and unhooded my lantern. As the light flooded the chamber, I looked around in astonishment. Here were wonders beyond even my wildest dreams!\nAs the light from my lamp filled the chamber beyond the rock fall, I looked around in astonishment. Everywhere was the warm glitter of Dwarven alloys. I had found an untouched section of the ancient city! My heart pounding with excitement, I looked around me. The room was vast, the roof soaring up into darkness beyond the reach of my lamp, the far end lost in shadows with only a tantalizing glimmer hinting at treasures not yet revealed. Along each wall stood rows of mechanical men, intact except for one oddity: their heads had been ritually removed and placed on the floor at their feet. This could mean only one thing -- I had discovered the tomb of a great Dwarven noble, maybe even a king! Burials of this type had been discovered before, most famously by Ransom's expedition to Hammerfell, but no completely intact tomb had ever been found. Until now.\nBut if this was truly a royal burial, where was the tomb? I stepped forward gingerly, the rows of headless bodies standing silently as they had for eons, their disembodied eyes seeming to watch me as I passed. I had heard wild tales of the Curse of the Dwarves, but had always laughed it off as superstition. But now, breathing the same air as the mysterious builders of this city, which had lain undisturbed since the cataclysm that spelled their doom, I felt a twinge of fear. There was some power here, I felt, something malevolent that resented my presence. I stopped for a moment and listened. All was silent.\nExcept... it seemed I heard a faint hiss, regular as breathing. I fought down a sudden surge of panic. I was unarmed, not thinking of danger in my haste to explore past the blocked passage. Sweat dripped down my face as I scanned the gloom for any movement. The room was warm, I suddenly noticed, much warmer than the rest of the labyrinth thus far. My excitement returned. Could I have found a section of the city still connected to a functioning steam grid? Pipes ran along the walls, as in all sections of the city. I walked over and placed my hand on one. It was hot, almost too hot to touch! Now I saw that in places where the ancient piping had corroded, small jets of steam were escaping -- the sound I had heard. I laughed at my own credulity.\nI now advanced quickly to the far end of the room, giving a cheerful salute to the ranks of mechanical soldiers who had appeared so menacing only moments before. I smiled with triumph as the light swept back the darkness of centuries to reveal the giant effigy of a Dwarven king standing on a raised dais, his metal hand clutching his rod of office. This was the prize indeed! I circled the dais slowly, admiring the craftsmanship of the ancient Dwarves. The golden king stood twenty feet tall under a freestanding domed cupola, his long upswept beard jutting forward proudly as his glittering metal eyes seemed to follow me. But my superstitious mood had passed, and I gazed benevolently on the old Dwarven king. My king, as I had already begun to think of him. I stepped onto the dais to get a better look at the sculpted armor. Suddenly the eyes of the figure opened and it raised a mailed fist to strike!\nI leaped to one side as the golden arm came crashing down, striking sparks from the steps where I had stood a moment before. With a hiss of steam and the whir of gears, the giant figure stepped ponderously out from under its canopy and strode towards me with frightening speed, its eyes tracking me as I scrambled backwards. I dodged behind a pillar as the fist whistled down again. I had dropped my lantern in the confusion, and now I crept into the darkness outside the pool of light, hoping to slip between the headless mechanisms and thus escape back to the safety of the passageway. Where had the monster gone? You would think that a twenty-foot golden kind would be hard to miss, but he was nowhere to be seen. The guttering lamp only illuminated a small part of the room. He could be hiding anywhere in the gloom. I crawled faster. Without warning, the dim ranks of Dwarven soldiers in front of me went flying as the monstrous guardian loomed before me. He had cut off my escape! As I dodged backwards, blow after blow whistled down as the implacable machine followed me relentlessly, driving me into the far corner of the room. At last there was nowhere left for me to go. My back was to the wall. I glared up at my foe, determined to die on my feet. The huge fists lifted for one final blow.\nThe room blazed with sudden light. Bolts of purple energy crackled across the metal carapace of the Dwarven monster, and it halted, half-turning to meet this new threat. Master Arum had come! I was about to raise a cheer when the giant figure turned back to me, unharmed by the lightning bolt hurled by Master Arum, determined to destroy this first intruder. I shouted out \"Steam! Steam!\" as the giant raised his fist to crush me into the floor. There was a hiss and a gust of bitter cold and I looked up. The monster was now covered with a shell of ice, frozen in the very moment of dispatching me. Master Arum had understood. I leaned against the wall with relief.\nThe ice cracked above me. The giant golden king stood before me, the shell of ice falling away, his head swiveling towards me in triumph. Was there no stopping this Dwarven monstrosity?! But then the light faded from his eyes, and his arms dropped to his sides. The magical frost had worked, cooling its steam-driven energy.\nAs Master Arum and the diggers crowded around me, congratulating me on my narrow escape, my thoughts drifted. I imagined my return to the Imperial City, and I knew that this would be my greatest triumph yet. How could I possibly top this find? Perhaps it was time to move on. Recovering the fabled Eye of Argonia... now that would be a coup! I smiled to myself, reveling in the glory of the moment but already planning my next adventure."

The dark elves deserve our condolences, but thus far they do not show themselves deserving of the simplest acts of charity. There are very different approaches to how to deal with the imminent problem of Morrowind, and I offer two options as seen in practice in Skyrim. One should serve as an exemplar, the other a cautionary tale.\nConsider Riften, which shares a border with the ruined province. A number of the dark elves have made their homes there, but they are expected to earn their livelihoods as is any other citizen of the great city. They ply trades as merchants, work in the temple, and serve in the keep. Honest labor, to be admired from a race that was so recently in such dire straits as to even warrant this discussion. Today the city still has its share of problems, but they are not traceable to any influx of outsiders in their presence. In short, the dark elves have properly assimilated themselves into the Skyrim way of life, to be expected from any newcomer to these lands.\nFor an alternative approach, we only have to look at the once-proud city of Windhelm to see what can happen when our arms are cast too wide open in welcome. To think that the city of Ysgramor, whose very name was made in driving out the elves from our sacred home, would open itself as a welcome destination for any refugee from the smoking sulphur, is a disgrace to the very idea of being a Nord.\nAnd what has become of this? Predictably, the lazy, discontented rabble has descended into squalor in an area now delicately referred to as \"the Gray Quarter\" of the city. They were not expected to contribute and so have not. That they attempt to make over a proud Nord city into a little pocket of Morrowind is insulting enough, but the amount of unrest they have provoked even within the proper city walls should give any other Jarl reason to fear.\nThe Nords I talk to in the city speak of constant strife and crime coming from the Gray Quarter, with no respite in sight. The city guard barely patrol there, leaving the dark elves to mete out whatever passes for justice in their native customs. The respectable families of the city, the Cruel-Seas and Shatter-Shields, speak with an almost parental affection of the Argonians in their employ, but the dark elves have made no effort to ingratiate or assimilate themselves to the proper city-dwellers.\nThere is cause for optimism, though, as Jarl Ulfric is not nearly so tolerant of these substandard beings as his fathers were. Indeed, the soft hand of Hoag can be seen in the cities Argonian population as well; the fish-men, at least, have learned how to best contribute to their new home. They have proven themselves as models, toiling at the docks with utmost efficiency and bright smiles. It would do the dark elves well to pay heed to their scaly cousins. I would expect in due course that they will find themselves either contributing more directly or once again wandering the land in search of roof and warmth."

Then you need to read this book from cover to cover. Learning to identify the shadowmark can mean the difference between making a fortune and ending up with a blade in your gut.\nThe clever little marks are carved all over Skyrim... mostly on the doorframes or fronts of buildings, but you can find them pretty much anywhere a thief's been. It's the way we talk to each other without talking. Keeps the newer thieves from becoming dead thieves and all that nonsense. There aren't that many of the bloody things, so I don't want to hear any excuses about not having the time to learn them.\nAnyway, enough of my gabbing. Time to put your wizard's cap on and do a little research.\n\nGlossary\n\tof Shadowmarks\n\"The Guild\"\nThis is the symbol for the Guild. This means the place is as safe as the Flagon's cistern. If you see this shadowmark, someone from the Guild is nearby for certain.\n\"Safe\"\nWe usually leave this shadowmark when we've scouted and found a safe way around something, a hallway without traps or maybe a house that's already cleared out. If you see one of these, head the way it's pointing and you'll be fine.\n\n\"Danger\"\nIf you see this shadowmark, head the other way or take your life in your own hands. It means there's something ahead or beyond that door that wants to turn you inside-out.\n\"Escape Route\"\nNow, on the rare occasion (it better be a rare occasion if you want to work in the Guild) that you find yourself in jail, look for this little beauty. You see this shadowmark and escape is just a few steps away.\n\n\"Protected\"\nWe put these shadowmarks on places we don't want you to go. As in stay out of there or there's going to be a boot up the backside. These people are under the Guild's protection and should never be robbed or assaulted.\n\n\"Fence\"\nThis should quickly become your favorite shadowmark. The person near this mark will buy your... hard-earned stolen goods for a fair price.\n\"Thieves' Cache\"\nWho says we only take and never give back? If you find this shadowmark near a chest or maybe a hollowed log, you're in for a surprise... a gift from the Guild for the thief in the field. Whoever said membership didn't have its privileges?\n\"Loot\"\nThere's something near this shadowmark worth stealing. Saves you from breaking into a place only to find the people don't even have two septim to rub together.\n\"Empty\"\nThe opposite of the Loot Shadowmark. Pass on this place, there's nothing inside."

    "text": "Shezarr and the Divines\nby\n\tFaustillus Junius\n\tSubcurator of Ancient Theology and Paleonumerology\n\tImperial Library\n\nThe position Shezarr enjoys in Cyrodilic worship if often misconstrued. He, and a thousand other deities, have sizeable cults in the Imperial City. Shezarr is especially venerated in the Colovian West, though he is called Shor there, as the West Kings are resolutely, and religiously, Nordic.\nThe haziness of Shezarr's relationship to the Divines (he is often called their 'Missing Sibling') begins with St. Alessia, the so-called 'Slave Queen of Cyrodiil, the founder figure of the original Cyrodilic Empire. In the earliest Cyro-Nordic stories of the Heartland, Shezarr fought against the Ayleids (the 'Heartland Highelves') on mankind's behalf. Then, for some unknown reason, he vanishes from the stage (presumably to help other humans elsewhere), and, without his leadership, the Ayleids conquer the humans and enslave them.\nThis slavery lasts for generations. The isolated humans eventually begin to venerate the pantheon of their masters, or at least assimilate so much of High Elven religious practices into their native traditions that the two become indistinguishable.\nIn 1E242, under the leadership of Alessia, her demigod lover, Morihaus-Breath-of-Kyne, and the infamous Pelinal Whitestrake, the Cyrodilic humans revolt. When Skyrim lends its armies to the Slave-Queen of the South, the revolution succeeds. The Ayleid Hegemonies are quickly overthrown. Shortly thereafter, White Gold Tower is captured by Alessia's forces, and she promptly declares herself the first Empress of Cyrodiil. Part of the package meant that she had to become the High Priestess of Akatosh, as well.\nAkatosh was an Aldmeri god, and Alessia's subjects were as-yet unwilling to renounce their worship of the Elven pantheon. She found herself in a very sensitive political situation. She needed to keep the Nords as her allies, but they were (at that time) fiercely opposed to any adoration of Elven deities. On the other hand, she could not force her subjects to revert back to the Nordic pantheon, for fear of another revolution. Therefore, concessions were made and Empress Alessia instituted a new religion: the Eight Divines, an elegant, well-researched synthesis of both pantheons, Nordic and Aldmeri.\nShezarr, as a result, had to change. He could no longer be the bloodthirsty anti-Aldmer warlord of old. He could not disappear altogether either, or the Nords would have withdrawn their support of her rule. In the end, he had become \"the spirit behind all human undertaking.\" Even though this was merely a thinly-disguised, watered-down version of Shor, it was good enough for the Nords.\nAs for why Tiber Septim has not attempted to 'revitalize' Shezarr during his wars against the Aldmeri Dominion, we can only speculate that, at this time, memories of the Alessian Order's follies (the Dragon Break, the War of Righteousness, the defeat at Gelnumbria Moors) would only damage his campaign for the Imperial Crown.\n"

    "text": "Skyrim's Rule:\nAn Outsider's View\nby\nAbdul-Mujib Ababneh\nIn my travels, and they have been many, I have encountered many strange peoples and cultures, in many different provinces of the Empire. And in each, I have found a method of governing and customs of leadership unique to that particular province.\nIn Black Marsh, for example, the Argonian King relies upon his Shadowscale Assassins to eliminate threats secretly, without the common knowledge of his people. In the Imperial Province of Cyrodiil, the Emperor may rule directly, but the power granted to his Elder Council cannot be understated.\nDuring a recent journey to Skyrim, that harsh, frozen realm of the Nords, I was able for the first time to witness the unique manner of rule of this strong, proud people.\nIt would appear that the entire province of Skyrim is separated into territories known as \"holds,\" and each hold finds its seat of power in one of the great, ancient cities. And in each of those cities, there rules that hold's king, known as a Jarl.\nThe Jarls of Skyrim are, as a whole, a fierce sight indeed. Sitting on their thrones, ready to administer justice, or send their forces out to quell some local threat, be it a pack of feral wolves or a terrifying giant that has wandered too close to a settlement.\nIn observing these Jarls, I found each to of course have his or her own unique personality and leadership style. But what I perhaps did not expect - especially considering the Nord leaders' unfair reputation as barbarians or uncivilized chieftains - was the formal structure of each Jarl's court. For while that hold's leader may be the one to sit on the throne, there is also a collection of functionaries who serve very specific and important roles.\nThe court wizard counsels the Jarl in all matters magical, and may even sell services or spells to the keep's visitors. The Steward is the Jarl's primary advisor, and generally takes care of the more mundane aspects of running the keep, the city, or even the hold, depending on the situation. And woe is the fool who defies the Housecarl - a personal bodyguard who rarely leaves the Jarl's side, and has pledged to sacrifice his or her own life to save that of their honored leader, if ever the need should arrive.\nBut as mighty and influential as each individual Jarl is, Skyrim's true power comes from the strength of its High King. The High King is ruler above all, and is always one of the Jarls, selected by a body called the \"Moot\" - a specially convened council of all the Jarls, who meet with the express purpose of choosing Skyrim's High King. Or so it is, in theory.\nThe reality, however, is that the High King swears fealty to the Emperor, and as Solitude is the city most directly influenced by Imperial culture and politics, the Jarl of Solitude has served as High King for generations. The Moot, therefore, is more formality and theater than anything else.\nBut as I prepared to leave Skyrim, I could feel a change in the air, sense the trepidation of some of the good Nord people. Many seemed unhappy with the Empire's continued presence in their land. And the outlawing of the worship of Talos as the Ninth Divine - a stipulation of the White-Gold Concordat, the peace treaty between the Empire and Aldmeri Dominion - has only strengthened that division.\nSo while the Jarls of Skyrim still control their holds, and those Jarls are ruled over by their Imperial-sanctioned High King, will there come a day when the Moot convenes to select a new High King - one that is not, as many would say, the Emperor's \"Solitude puppet\"?\nIf that day comes, I will be thankful to be far away from Skyrim, in my own home of Hammerfell. For such a decision could well mean civil war, and I fear that such a conflict would tear the fierce and beautiful Nord people asunder."

    "text": "Songs of Skyrim\nCompiled by Giraud Gemaine\n\tHistorian of the Bards College Solitude\n\nRagnar the Red is a traditional song of Whiterun. Despite the grim final image the song is generally regarded as light and rollicking and a favorite in inns across Skyrim.\n\nRagnar The Red\n\tThere once was a hero named Ragnar the Red,\n\twho came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead!\n\tAnd the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade,\n\tas he told of bold battles and gold he had made!\n\tBut then he went quiet, did Ragnar the Red,\n\twhen he met the shieldmaiden Matilda who said...\n\tOh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead!\n\tNow I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed!\n\tAnd so then came the clashing and slashing of steel,\n\tas the brave lass Matilda charged in full of zeal!\n\tAnd the braggart named Ragnar was boastful no moooooree...\n\twhen his ugly red head rolled around on the floor!\n\n\nThe Dragonborn Comes has been handed down from generation to generation of bards. The Dragonborn in Nord culture is the archetype of what a Nord should be. The song itself has been used to rally soldiers and to bring hope.\n\nThe Dragonborn Comes\nOur hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart.\n\tI tell you, I tell you, the Dragonborn comes.\n\tWith a Voice wielding power of the ancient Nord art.\n\tBelieve, believe, the Dragonborn comes.\n\tIt's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes.\n\tBeware, beware, the Dragonborn comes.\n\tthe darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows.\n\tYou'll know, You'll know the Dragonborn's come.\n\n\nThe Age of Oppression and The Age of Aggression are variants of one song. It isn't known which of the two was written first but the tune, with loyalty appropriate lyrics, is quite popular on both sides of the war.\n\nThe Age of Oppression\n\tWe drink to our youth, and to days come and gone.\n\tFor the age of oppression is now nearly done.\n\tWe'll drive out the Empire from this land that we own.\n\tWith our blood and our steel we will take back our home.\n\tAll hail to Ulfric! You are the High King!\n\tIn your great honor we drink and we sing.\n\tWe're the children of Skyrim, and we fight all our lives.\n\tAnd when Sovngarde beckons, every one of us dies!\n\tBut this land is ours and we'll see it wiped clean.\n\tOf the scourge that has sullied our hopes and our dreams.\n\nThe Age of Aggression\n\tWe drink to our youth, to days come and gone.\n\tFor the age of aggression is just about done.\n\tWe'll drive out the Stormcloaks and restore what we own.\n\tWith our blood and our steel we'll take back our home.\n\tDown with Ulfric the killer of kings.\n\tOn the day of your death we'll drink and we'll sing.\n\tWe're the children of Skyrim, and we fight all our lives.\n\tAnd when Sovngarde beckons, every one of us dies!\n\tBut this land is ours and we'll see it wiped clean.\n\tOf the scourge that has sullied our hopes and our dreams.\n\nThe following is an ancient song we've only recently been able to translate. Without a tune or a sure pronunciation the song is lost to time. It's included here to show the deep history of song here in Skyrim. The original version...\n\nDovahkiin, Dovahkiin, naal ok zin los vahriin,wah dein vokul mahfaeraak ahst vaal!\n\tAhrk fin norok paal graan fod nust hon zindro zaan, Dovahkiin, fah hin kogaan mu draal!\n\tHuzrah nu, kul do od, wah aan bok lingrah vod, Aahrk fin tey, boziik fun, do fin gein!\n\tWo lost fron wah ney dov, ahrk fin reyliik do jul, voth aan suleyk wah ronit faal krein!\n\tAhrk fin zul, rok drey kod, nau tol morokei frod, rul lot Taazokaan motaad voth kein!\n\tSahrot Thu'um, med aan tuz, vey zeim hokoron pah, ol fin Dovahkiin komeyt ok rein!\n\tAhrk fin Kel lost prodah, do ved viing ko fin krah, tol fod zeymah win kein meyz fundein!\n\tAlduin, feyn do jun, kruziik vokun staadnau, voth aan bahlok wah diivon fin lein!\n\tNuz aan sul, fent alok, fod fin vul dovah nok, fen kos nahlot mahfaeraak ahrk ruz!\n\tPaaz Keizaal fen kos stin nol bein Alduin jot, Dovahkiin kos fin saviik do muz!\n\nAnd the translation...\n\nDragonborn, Dragonborn, by his honor is sworn, To keep evil forever at bay!\n\tAnd the fiercest foes rout when they hear triumph's shout, Dragonborn, for your blessing we pray!\n\tHearken now, sons of snow, to an age, long ago, and the tale, boldly told, of the one!\n\tWho was kin to both wyrm, and the races of man, with a power to rival the sun!\n\tAnd the Voice, he did wield, on that glorious field, when great Tamriel shuddered with war!\n\tMighty Thu'um, like a blade, cut through enemies all, as the Dragonborn issued his roar!\n\tAnd the Scrolls have foretold, of black wings in the cold, that when brothers wage war come unfurled\n\tAlduin, Bane of Kings, ancient shadow unbound, with a hunger to swallow the world!\n\tBut a day, shall arise, when the dark dragon's lies, will be silenced forever and then!\n\tFair Skyrim will be free from foul Alduin's maw, Dragonborn be the savior of men!"

    "text": "Songs of the Return, Volume 2, The First Tale of the Darumzu\nOur great lord Ysgramor, the harbinger of us all, did then sent forth his two beloved sons (with him the only other survivors of the brutalities of Saarthal) to seek out the bravest warriors of the land and mount the great return.\nYngol and Ylgar, they were called, and they were known among Atmora as fine warriors with bright eyes and dawning futures. Yngol, the elder, was the brave strategist, bringing his learnings to bear on the battlefield that his enemies would be defeated before they even know the battle had begun. Ylgar, the younger, was possessed of an unwavering spirit that drove his singular prowess to overwhelming feats in war. Together, the mind and the arm, they were capable of sowing a destruction most thorough and glorious to any foe who stood before them.\nBefore they parted ways to gather their crews, the two clasped arms and necks in the old fashion and laughed at the heavens for their stories to come.\nYoung Ylgar then took to the massive shipyards of Jyljyrfyk at the southern point and commissioned two ships for himself and his brother. He would command the Darmuzu, and his brother the Harakk, thus carrying the names of the two favored stars of their heavens. The shipmakers spirits had been suitably filled by Ysgramor's tales of the savage elves, and they set about to birth ships that befit their noble homeland.\nArrangements having been made, Ylgar set forth to the academies of honored soldiers, seeking out his most trusted friends and advisors to join him on the venture of the Return. By now the stories of the new land to the south were spreading before him, and the emergence of his presence was enough to cause the finest warriors to lay down their present undertakings and follow him.\nSo was he able to call to his side the great Shield-Sisters, Froa and Grosta (who thought and spoke as one), and they brought with their the wise war-teacher Adrimk, who first taught them to dance among the blades. She, in turn, mustered all the students at her command, whose names were not yet made, but some of whom would one day be know: Hermseskr (Who Threw his Shields), Urlach (Who Breathed Fire), Ramth the Greater, Merkyllian Ramth, and the Far-Sighted Uche, who would see the first of many dawns.\nOn the Day of Final Passage, when the many-oarded fleets would last see the distant green summers of Atmora, the brothers were near in their father's wake as the freshly joined Five Hundred would eagerly press onwards towards Tamriel. Ylgar could see his well-minded brother smiling from afar across the waves, and they shouted war-cries to each other, longing for the soon-day when their assembled crews would draw the treacherous elf blood itno the ground which they would now claim for their own rights.\nBut Kyne's ministrations are not to be taken lightly, and though her blessings gave wind to drive those brave sailors to their destiny, so too did her mmighty tears fall, to drive them apart. When the Storm of Separation first arose, young Ylgar had no fear, for his crew was strong and able, and their ship drove true through the forest of swells as though pulled by the rope of fate.\nWhen the skies cleared, and Ylgar glimpsed again, with new eyes, the land of his past and future home, he knew his brothers vessel was not within his horizon. The Darumzu, arriving late, drew forth onto the sands and Ylgar rushed to his father to seek word of his brother. The Grear Ysgramor, harbinger of us all, wept for his lost son, and sought comfort in the arms of his only remaining joy. The crew of the Harakk became the first deaths among the Five Hundred, and Ylfar was so enraged with love for his brother that his crew would soon be counted as the first among the many noble and honored names in the Companions.\nSongs of the Return, Volume 5\nIt came to pass that our great lord Ysgramor, the Harbinger of us all, sat before an encampment fire. The crews of the Jorrvaskr, the Fallowfire, and the Kaal Kaaz bade him eat, and boast, and drink. For the boon members of the Five Hundred Companions were abroad in the land. Stories were told, hearts won and lost, and always the smell of roasting meat hung in the air. The greatest of us all beckoned every warrior to his side, and spoke the tale of Wuuthrad's forging.\nEvery Mer the Harbinger slew died at Wuuthrad's bite. All through the long campaign, the only weapon that would fit in the Harbinger's hand was the mighty Wuuthrad. As he told it, the most legendary of axes was forged in the darkest of nights.\nIt was the Night of Tears. Ysgramor sat staring out across the waters. He rode upon the last ship in his fleet, fleeing Tamriel for the shores of Atmora. From that vantage point, he watched as Saarthal—the first city—burned. A swollen sky poured rain upon the flames and upon the sea. And the greatest of us all wept bitter tears.\nSo great was the grief of the Harbinger that, instead of salty sorrow, Ysgramor wept tears of purest ebony. His eldest, Yngol, collected the tears in a stein and held his father in a warm embrace. He poured mead down the Harbinger's great throat, wrapped furs around the Harbinger's great shoulders, and slung the Harbinger into a great hammock below decks.\nThen he set to work. For Yngol, eldest son to the Harbinger of us all, was the greatest smith our people have ever known. There, on the sea, Yngol set to work with his tools. He used lightning to heat the Night's Tears, the ocean's swell to cool them, and always his hammer-blows rang in concert with the rising wind.\nWhen Ysgramor awoke the next morning, Yngol presented him with a mighty axe, hewn from the sorrow that had laid him low just the night before. And the Harbinger of us all embraced his son. He cried out in joy, sadness, and rage. And there on the deck of the last ship from Saarthal, Ysgramor named his axe Wuuthrad, which means \"Storm's Tears\" in the language of Atmora.\nIt was then, in telling the tale, that Ysgramor paused. The Harbinger of us all called out to lost Yngol, who had been with the crew of the Harakk in the Storm of Seperation. For his son, his eldest and greatest joy, was with him always. He who had bound the storm's tears, he said, rode with him always in the days of the noble and honored Five Hundred.\nSongs of the Return, Volume 7, The Tale of the Jorrvaskr\nWhen at last the rightful claim of Saarthal had been retaken, driving the murderous elves back to their lofty cities, did great Ysgramor turn and let loose the fearsome war cry that echoed across all the oceans. The Five Hundred who yet stood joined in the ovation for the victory and the lament for their fallen peers. It was said to be heard on the distant and chilling green shores of Atmora, and the ancestors knew their time had come to cross the seas.\nAs the reverberations echoed out and drowned to silence, all looked to Ysgramor, who bore the blessed Wuuthrad, for his next commandment. With his lungs that bellowed forth the fury of humanity, he bade them to continue their march, that the devious Mer might know the terror they had brought on themselves with their trickery.\n\"Go forth,\" he roared. \"Into the belly of this new land. Drive the wretched from their palaces of idleness. Oblige them to squalor and toil, that they would see their betrayals as the all-sin against our kind. Give no quarter. Show no kindness. For they would not give nor show you the same.\" (Our great forebear gave this order as he did not yet understand the prophecy of the Twin Snakes, that he would be fated to die before seeing the true destiny of his line.)\nHearing this, the Circle of Captains gathered each their crews unto themselves. From here, they decreed, we will go forth. Let each ship's band make its own way, seeking their fates to the open sun. A night spent in feasting, the Oath of the Companions was sworn anew, with each of the Five Hundred (so they still named their count, in honor of the shields that were broken at Saarthal) swearing to act as Shield-Brother and Shield-Sister to any of the Atmoran line were their fates to ever again entwine.\nAs the red hands of dawn stretched from the east, so broke the Five Hundred Companions of Ysgramor, setting about their journeys, sailing now across the land with waves of stone and crests of trees flowing under their footed hulls.\nThe first to break from the grounded fleet was the crew of the Jorrvaskr, who had been formed of Ysgramor's closest friends. Their captain was known as Jeek of the River, so called by the Harbinger himself from their youths passed in glory. When assembling their glistening hull, he sought out the labors of Menro and Manwe, who now bore the native timbers across this new land of Tamriel. Among their fiercest were Tysnal (Who Was Twice-Named), and Terr, his twin and Shield-Brother whose girth was never spoken of to his face. There were others, too, in their band -- Meksim the Walker, Brunl (Who Fought with his Off-Hand), and Yust the Smiler. These and others were sworn to Jeek, and they pushed forth into the shadows where yet the sun had not reached.\nSouthwards they went, by beast and by foot. Elves they found, though none remain to tell what those battles entailed. The numbers of the Jorrvaskr never faltered, so shrewd were they in battle, with minds as sharp as their blades.\nOnce, as the sun beat from its high-home, Jonder the Tiny, the one who ran ahead, came over the hill to tell what was seen. Amidst a vast plain his eyes had met a monument of a bird, whose eyes and beak were opened in flame. When his brothers and sisters crested the hill, they too saw its glory, but they were afraid for no elven settlement could be seen to the horizon.\n\"But this is not seemly,\" said Kluwe, who went by Loate when hiding his face. \"Is not this wide land fit for harvest? Why have not the elves, vile to their core, seen to exploit and tame it?\" They asked of their elven captives (for they had many) what they found unfit about these plains. Yet even the captives who still bore their tongues could say nothing of the valley. They looked with fear at the winged colossus, and from their babblings did the warriors of the Jorrvaskr learn that it was older than even the elves themselves. Of those who wrought it solid from its mother-stone, nothing could be said, but it was known to drive a magic almost as old as Nirn itself, some remnant of the gods' efforts to render a paradise in Mundus before the shattering of Lorkhan.\nThis first of many, this crew of the Jorrvaskr, heathens and ancestors to us all, feared no stories or gods. Indeed, if there was something the elves feared, they would have it for their own. Thus began the labors, once more, of Menro and Manwe, whose eager hands again laid to the Atmoran wood which had born them all across the sea, and what was their ship became their shelter as this valley became their purview until the end of all their days.\nThus began the building of the Great City, circled by the running of the White River, as brought forth by these beloved of Ysgramor, yet but twenty-two of the glorious Five Hundred Companions.\nSong of the Return, Volume 19, The Second Tale of the Ylgermet\nWhen that final battle at the barren pass was completed, and the melting snow carried elf-blood back to the sea, the crew of the Kaal Kaaz, the Sadon Reyth, and the most exalted crew of our lord's ship, the Ylgermet, at last parted ways, never to join shields again. They drew apart in that form which is not a loss, but a gain knowing one's heart can be carried in the chests of others. So great was the love that those first of the Five Hundred had for each other, and most especially for the great Ysgramor, harbinger of us all.\nThey pressed eastwards, seeking the sea, when they came upon the barrow of Yngol, the mighty of Ysgramor's son who had fallen to the whims of Kyne rather than the treachery of the elves.\n\tOur lord had not expected to lay eyes upon it again so soon, and his grief flowed anew at the sight of it, as a reopened wound will bleed as it did when first received.\nHis eyes turned to the south, where a river met the sea, and decreed that there would he and the crew of the Ylgermet create a great city, in monument to the glories of mankind, and that from his palace he might always look upon the hill of his dead son's resting place, and feel that his line would know peace in this new home that was never known in Atmora.\nThe elven captives were set to work, bringing forth stone to build in their conqueror's fashion. As many elves died in the building of the city as had the crew of the Ylgermet slain while on way to its site, and Ysgramor drove the wretches ever more, to build higher, to lay a claim to the river so that none might pass into the interior of this land without first showing due respect to its rightful claimant.\nThus was the great bridge constructed, forever striding the river that no elf might sneak through to avenge his devious cousins. As the bridge was build long, so too was the palace built high, spires reaching the sky to show dominion even over the very winds that had brought forth such grief.\nIn the deep hollows beneath the city, a great tomb was prepared for the day when lord Ysgramor, harbinger of us all, would be called home to glory in Sovngarde. But as we know, he chose instead to be buried on the shore, facing towards Atmora, that though his heart lived and died in this new land, it would forever yearn for the beauties of still-green Atmora, before the freezing took it.\nThus was founding of Windhelm, the city of Kings, though her history is long and her glories did not end with her founder.\nSongs of the Return, Volume 24, The First Tale of the Krilot Lok\n[When the time came for] breaking of camp, not all crews took southwards across the rolling lands. Some turned with quick eyes back to their ships, for their hearts were bounded to the waves as sure as they were bounded to each other [as allied Companions].\nOne such crew was that of the Krilot Lok, sinewy long folk from the [eastern] edge of Atmora. Their ruddy skin matched the dawn and it was often said that morning herself learned [her glorious colors from] the first faces to meet her at the break of day. The great Kyne lifted their souls and their winds, propelling them westwards with the new lands of Tamriel ever beckoning to the south.\nIn time, these perpetual wanderers came upon sights fearsome and terrible. Entire kingdoms of men beyond their recognition, skin charred like overcooked meat. Elves [even more devious than the northern betrayers] disgraced their horizons, until they learned the sheltered ways between. Great deserts the likes of which were never known in the homeland, peopled by beasts that spoke like men, with the [savagery?] of elves. Many a notable and well-sung Companion met his end at the spears of the legged snakes of the southern marsh.\nAmong the brave crew of the Krilot Lok were of Roeth and Breff the Elder, the great Shield-Brothers (who often swapped spears), and [their] war-wives, Britte and Greyf (the fair child), Shield-Sisters in their own right who could bring [the face of terror?] across the ice-chilled seas. Together these four stared into the abyss of trees that formed the foul-smelling homeland of the snake-men. And as they were blessed Atmorans who feared no shore of Tamriel, they ventured forth to seek out their glories in the most dangerous of these new lands.\nOnward they flew, ravaging the swamplands, beating a trail between themselves and their ship such that they would never lose sight of the shore. In the far-off day when at last Roeth would fall, when Britte screamed her famed war-cry so that all the marshes were emptied, this trail would fill once more with the treacherous snake men. So began the [burning?] march of these great captains of us all.\nSongs of the Return, Volume 27\nAt last Sinmur was brought to bay. Ysgramor, Harbinger of us all, boldly led the remaining Companions into the final battle. Many a brave Companion had already fallen to the giants. Stalwart Valdur and Sly Hakra, long may their spirits be honored, fell assaulting the wily half-giant. Many others now trod the blessed pathways to Sovngarde. With all his kin slain, only Sinmur still defied the greatest among us.\nThe axe Wuuthrad, dripping with the gore of a hundred dead giants, gleamed in the darkness of Sinmur's barrow. Ysgramor strode forward, halting his followers with a gesture. With another he dared Sinmur to face him in mortal combat. The giant-kin proved willing, roaring his defiance and leaping to battle. His massive, iron-bound club swung forward to crush. Our Lord Ysgramor stepped aside and the club shattered the stone a pace from his side. Wuuthrad sang a blood song as it chopped into the club, breaking it asunder as if made from straw.\nSinmur howled his rage and hurled the stub of his once-fearsome weapon at Our Lord Ysgramor's head. He grappled Ysgramor, seeking to squeeze life away. A roar of laughter was the answer the monster received. Ysgramor's forehead and knee delivered two mighty blows. Sinmur screeched and fell to his knees before our lord.\nA song of death and delight keened from Wuuthrad as Ysgramor buried it deep in the giant-kin's skull. A splatter of gore and a death rattle came from Sinmur as Ysgramor gave a victory yell. The Companions cheered mightily as Wuuthrad waved overhead. The depredations of the giant and his vile kin were at last ended. And the legend of Ysgramor, Harbinger of us all, grew mightily that day.\nSongs of the Return, Volume 49\nWith the Circle of Captains' decree that each ship's crew should go forth of its own accord, making its own legend, the crew of the Fallowfire rejoiced. They yearned to bring the fear of Men to new lands of the Mer that had not yet been put to the sword. They took to heart their Lord Ysgramor's words to \"Give no quarter. Show no kindness.\"\nA pyre upon the shore was raised for the Fallowfire. The ashes of their beloved vessel fell upon the waters and drifted toward Atmora, cutting all ties with their homeland. Led by Captain Gurilda Sharktooth, the crew of the Fallowfire turned their backs to the sea and strode inland.\nSouth they traveled, seeking lands untrammeled by others of Ysgramor's crews. South and south they went, sowing the blood vengeance demanded by Ysgramor. No Mer escaped their axes once seen, no settlement remained unburnt in their path. Truly the Fallowfires brought their lord's wrath to bear upon the treacherous Elves. As they journeyed, so the terror of them grew among the Mer.\nGurilda led her crew to the foothills of a lofty range of mountains. These they named Ysgramor's Teeth and long they sought a pass through them. When finally a way was found, the crew crossed over and into a new land. \"The Rift\" they called this region, for it was riven by deep canyons and swift-flowing rivers. In the name of Fallowfire, their lost Companions, and Yngol, they scoured the land, burning Mer villages and putting all they encountered to the axe.\nFinally, the Mer offered battle. The cowardly Elves gathered in great numbers high atop a rocky hill, daring Gurilda's Companions to attack. And so they did. Challenges were offered, brave deeds were done, and heroes made. Battle raged through the day and as the sun touched the peaks of the western mountains, the Mer broke and fled. Gurilda lay dying, pierced by a multitude of weapons, but lived until sunset. Her spirit ascended to Sovngarde knowing her crew was victorious.\nThat day, the dominion of Elves over the Rift was ended. The Companions claimed the land in the name of Ysgramor, Harbinger of us all, and made it free to all Nords. To honor their dead, the Companions labored long, delving into the hillside to craft a tomb. Gurilda was buried there, with all her weapons and armor. There too were placed the remains of Bergitte the Toothless and Kajord Eagle-Eye, laid alongside Gurilda as they had fallen in battle, defending their captain. Others of the honored dead were entombed as well. A mighty cairn of stone was erected around the tomb entrance, to forever mark the grave.\nVikord One-Ear, long Gurilda's first mate but now captain, gazed long upon the hills rising about them and the valleys at their feet. This was a land he could love, where his people could prosper and grow. He decreed the crew's wandering at an end and caused a great hall to be built on the battle site. Thus was Fallowstone Hall created, in homage to the ship that carried them to these shores. From this time, the days of the Companions of the Rift are counted. Never may their glory fade!\nSongs of the Return, Volume 56, The Final Tale of the Chrion\nThese Songs of the Return are eternal and numerous, for these first Five Hundred, those Companions of Ysgramor who cleared the way for mankind’s rightful habitation, burned with a fire not seen since those days long passed. Each ship carried a crew that performed legendary feats that could feed the pride of any nation for a thousand years. And during this time of the broadening, scores of Companions wandered the land, bringing the light of the proper god to the heather land of elves and beasts.\nThey were but mortal, though, and in time, all would taste the glories of Sovngarde. It was in one of the uncounted years after the retaking of Saarthal that the crew of the Chrion was declaring their fortunes in the eastern lands near the Red Mountain. They were encamped, surrounded by bodies of murderous elves who had attempted to make them believe they held peace in their hearts. The shrewd Rhorlak was the Chrion's captain, though, and would show no quarter to the liars of the southlands, as had been commanded by his lord Ysgramor, harbinger of us all.\nIt was in this state of carousing that they were approaced by a young and breathless messenger of their sister crew from the Kall Kaaz. The boy (Asgeir, as his name is now sung) had ran unimaginable distance at breakneck speed from the blood-stained fields of the Clouded Sun, to deliver the news to all would would hear. When he reached their camp, he bellowed a great sob before releiving his heart of the news that the mighty Ysgramor had breathed his last.\nAsgeir continued his swift run, to inform the other crews as quickly as they could be found (for there were many now crawling the land, rendering our legacy from their deeds), and the camp of the Chrin descended into a mourning of the most forlorn sort. Among these fiercest sat the bravest men and fiercest women who had ever graced the dirt of this land, and they were brought low by such a notion. While we in the day-shine know only of Ysgramor's glory as the gleams of history, these Companions knew his might with their own eyes, and such a loss hands so heavily on the heart that mere words cannot express the altering of their world.\nFor indeed the stories tell that Rhorlak, the most battle-hardened and unflinching of all captains, did collapse with grief, and never again lifted his mighty axe. And all around Tamriel, as the news spread as dark cloud washes from horizon to horizon, did brilliant lights go out in silent honor of their fallen general and war-leader.\nSo ended the period of the Return, and the original glories of the Five Hundred Companions of Ysgramor, harbinger to us all."

What can be known is that souls are a source of mystic energy that can be harvested.\nEvery creature, living or dead, is powered by a soul. Without it, they are just lumps of flesh or piles of bones. This animating force can be contained within a soul gem, if the soul gem has the capacity. From the gem, the power can be used to power magical items.\nCenturies of experimentation has demonstrated that there are black souls and white souls. Only the rare black soul gem can hold the soul of a higher creature, such as a man or an elf. While the souls of lesser creatures can be captured by gems of many colors, they are all categorized as white soul gems. Hence the division of souls into black and white.\nWhite souls are far safer than black souls, although not as powerful. Beginning students of Mysticism should not dabble in black souls or black soul gems. Even if one were to ignore the guild strictures against the necromatic arts used to power black soul gems, it is dangerous to the caster to handle them for long. If the gem is not precisely the size of the encased soul, small bits of the caster's soul may leak into the gem when it is touched."

    "text": "Speculation regarding Sovngarde, the Nordic Hall of Valor\n\nDeath. It is something we all face. Or do we?\nJust ask the nearest Nord what he thinks of the end of life, and you'll likely be treated to a horrific story of blood, bone and viscera, of courageous deeds and heartbreaking sorrow. Carnage notwithstanding, there may be even more to death than the average Nord warrior realizes. New evidence suggests a life beyond the battlefield, where a valiant Nord may live forever, downing mead and engaging in contests of strength and skill. But in order to fully understand the possibility of a Nord's eternal life after death, one must first reexamine the legends surrounding that most wondrous of warrior's retreats - Sovngarde.\nAccording to the ancient writings and oral traditions of the Nords, going back as far as the Late Merethic Era, there exists a place so magnificent, so honored, that the entrance lies hidden from view. Sovngarde, it is called, built by the god Shor to honor those Nords who have proven their mettle in war. Within this \"Hall of Valor\" time as we know it has no meaning. The concepts of life and death are left on the doorstep, and those within exist in a sort of self-contained euphoria, free of pain, suffering and the worst malady a Nord could suffer - boredom.\nBut just how well hidden the entrance to Sovngarde is has been a matter of much scholarly debate, and there are those who believe Shor's great hall is just a myth, for there are no actual accounts from Nords who have experienced the wonders of Sovngarde then returned to tell the tale. Not that this has stopped anyone from looking. Some Nords spend a lifetime searching for the mysterious hidden entrance to Sovngarde. Most return home sad and broken, their hearts heavy with failure. They'll never know the pleasure of a mead flagon that never empties, or a wrestling tournament without end.\nWhat, some may ask, does the entrance to Sovngarde have to do with death? Everything, according to a series of ancient parchments recently discovered in the attic of a deceased Nord's home in Cyrodiil. What at first seemed to be a series of love letters was later found to be a correspondence between one Felga Four-Fingers, a medium of some note, and the ghost of a Nord warrior named Rolf the Large.\nAccording to the parchments, Rolf had spent his entire life searching for the entrance to Sovngarde, without success. He was returning home to his village of Skyrim when he was waylaid by a band of giants. Rolf fought bravely, but was quickly killed, and the giants proceeded to play catch with his head. Amazingly, all of this was seen by Rolf in ghostly form as he drifted away from the scene, soaring upwards into the heavens, where he finally arrived... in the magnificent hall of Sovngarde!\nRolf could not believe his good fortune, and his foolishness for not having realized the truth so many years before. For death was the entrance to Sovngarde. So he was told by Shor himself, who greeted Rolf the Large as a brother, and personally handed him a leg of roast mutton and the hand of a comely wench. Sovngarde, Shor told him, can be entered by any Nord who dies valiantly in honorable combat.\nIt is time for Nords to learn the truth. Eternal life can be theirs, without the need to spend an entire mortal life in vain pursuit of something completely unattainable. In the end, all valiant Nords can enter Sovngarde. Dismemberment, decapitation or evisceration seems a small price to pay for the chance to spend an eternity in Shor's wondrous hall."

    "text": "The \"Madmen\" of the Reach:\nA Cultural Treatise on the Forsworn\nby \nArrianus Arius\nImperial Scholar\nSince the legendary victory of Tiber Septim over the \"barbarian natives\" in the Battle of Old Hroldan, Imperial and Nord scholarship has cast the people of the Reach as little more than savages, prone to irrational fits of violence, worshipping old, heretical gods, and fetishizing beasts and nature spirits that any civilized person would best well avoid. In truth, these accounts are little more than \"victor's essays,\" a perspective narrowed by the Empire's constant strife with the ancient, proud people that lived in this land far before Tiber Septim walked the soil of Tamriel. In light of this, I hope to create a more complete, accurate, and fair assessment of a group that has long suffered under the role of \"enemy,\" \"troublemakers,\" and \"them.\"\nLet us begin with the Forsworn, the so-called \"madmen\" of the Reach. The Imperial Legion classifies them as little more than brigands, noting their constant raids and ambushes within the Hold. But none of their military reports asks the question of \"why?\" If they were merely a group of bandits, surely they would be focused on acquiring gold and minimizing deaths among their own. But the opposite is true in Forsworn attacks. Large sums of coin are often left behind, and their fighters easily throw away their lives rather than risk capture by Imperial soldiers.\nIt is this incongruity that led me to Markarth, the capital city of the Reach, in search of answers. There, I met one of the native peoples, an old woman who preferred to not be named in my writings. She told me of her family's long history. How she believes they originally came from High Rock, home of the Bretons (which would explain the similar faces and stature of the two peoples). How the Nords came and took their lands, their gods, and their culture from them. When asked about the Forsworn, the old woman would say that they are the \"real\" men and women of the Reach: those that refused to give in to the Nords. Those that still practiced the ancient traditions that the rest of their people had abandoned in exchange for peace.\nIn time, I was able to create trust with many more natives in my search that corroborated the old woman's story. By chance, one of them arranged a meeting between myself and what I thought was an elder member of his village. I was shocked to find that I was led to a camp, filled with the animal skulls, severed heads, and still beating hearts that I had read about from the military reports back in the Imperial City. There, I met Cortoran, a Forsworn, who seemed amused at the prospect of me writing down his story. Which I quote in full below:\n\"You want to know who the Forsworn are? We are the people who must pillage our own land. Burn our own ground. We are the scourge of the Nords. The axe that falls in the dark. The scream before the gods claim your soul. We are the true sons and daughters of the Reach. The spirits and hags have lived here from the beginning, and they are on our side. Go back. Go back and tell your Empire that we will have our own kingdom again. And on that day, we will be the ones burying your dead in a land that is no longer yours.\""

While this cannot be historically verified, the Adabal-a is certainly among the oldest written accounts to come down to us from the early First Era.\nPELINAL'S DEATH\nAnd in the blood-floored throne room of White-Gold, the severed head of Pelinal spoke to the winged-bull, Morihaus, demigod lover of Al-Esh, saying, \"Our enemies have undone me, and spread my body into hiding. In mockery of divine purpose, the Ayleids cut me into eighths, for they are obsessed with this number.\"\nAnd Morihaus, confused, snorted through his ring, saying, \"Your crusades went beyond her counsel, Whitestrake, but I am a bull, and therefore reckless in my wit. I think I would go and gore our prisoners if you had left any alive. You are blood-made-glorious, uncle, and will come again, as fox animal or light. Cyrod is still ours.\"\nThen Pelinal spoke again for the last time: \"Beware, Morihaus, beware! With the foresight of death I know now that my foe yet lives, bitter knowledge to take to my grave. Better that I had died believing myself the victor. Although cast beyond the doors of night, he will return. Be vigilant! I can no longer shield the host of Men from Umaril's retribution.\"\nALESSIA'S YOUTH DURING THE SLAVE-YEARS\nPerrif's original tribe is unknown, but she grew up in Sard, anon Sardarvar Leed, where the Ayleids herded in men from across all the Niben: kothri, nede, al-gemha, men-of-'kreath (though these were later known to be imported from the North), keptu, men-of-ge (who were eventually destroyed when the Flower King Nilichi made great sacrifice to an insect god named [lost]), al-hared, men-of-ket, others; but this was Cyrod, the heart of the imperatum saliache, where men knew no freedom, even to keep family, or choice of name except in secret, and so to their alien masters all of these designations were irrelevant.\nMen were given over to the lifting of stones, and the draining of the fields, and the upkeep of temple and road; or to become art-tortures for strange pleasures, as in the wailing wheels of Vindasel and the gut-gardens of Sercen; and flesh-sculpture, which was everywhere among the slaves of the Ayleids in those days; or, worse, the realms of the Fire King Hadhuul, where the begetting of drugs drawn from the admixture of daedrons into living hosts let one inhale new visions of torment, and children were set aflame for nighttime tiger sport.\nMORIHAUS EXPLAINS ALESSIA'S NAMES\nThen Morihaus said to them: \"In your tales you have many names for her: Al-Esh, given to her in awe, that when translated sounds like a redundancy, 'the high high', from which come the more familiar corruptions: Aleshut, Esha, Alessia. You knew her as Paravant, given to her when crowned, 'first of its kind', by which the gods meant a mortal worthy of the majesty that is killing-questing-healing, which is also Paraval, Pevesh, Perrethu, Perrif, and, in my case, for it is what I called her when we were lovers: Paravania.\"\n\"Though she is gone to me, she remains bathed in stars, first Empress, Lady of Heaven, Queen-ut-Cyrod.\"\nAnd they considered themselves full-answered, and departed."

    "text": "The Alduin/Akatosh Dichotomy\nby\nBy Alexandre Simon\nHigh Priest of the Akatosh Chantry, Wayrest\n\nAs High Priest of the Akatosh Chantry, I have dedicated my life to the service of the Great Dragon. He who was first at the Beginning. He who is greatest and most powerful of all the Divines. He who is the very embodiment of infinity.\nI am, quite obviously, a man of deep and unwavering faith. But not blind faith, for I am also a man of scholarly endeavors, and have always valued education and the pursuit of truth, in all its forms. And so, I have had the honor and privilege of making it my life's work to discover the truth about Akatosh, in all of our beloved Divine's incarnations.\nThroughout the civilized world (and I refer not only to the Empire, but to every nation on great Nirn that has embraced the virtues of learning and letters), the Great Dragon is worshipped. Usually, the highest of Divines is referred to as Akatosh. But what some may not be aware of is that he is occasionally referred to by two other names as well.\nThe Aldmer refer to Akatosh as Auri-El. The Nords call him Alduin. These names come up repeatedly in certain ancient texts, and in each one, it is clear that the deity in question is none other than he whom we call Akatosh.\nYet there are those who believe, even in this enlightened age, that this is not so. That the regional interpretations of Akatosh are not interpretations of Akatosh at all. Rather, they are references to altogether different deities, deities who may or may not share the same aspects or be the Great Dragon at all.\nMany Altmer of Summerset Isle worship Auri-El, who is the soul of Anui-El, who in turn is the soul of Anu the Everything. But if you ask the high elves themselves (as  I did, when I traveled to Summerset Isle to continue my research), the majority will concede that Auri-El is but Akatosh with a different name, colored by their own cultural beliefs.\nSo maybe it comes as no surprise that the real theological dissention lies in Skyrim, among the Nord people - renowned as much for their stubbornness as they are their hardiness and prowess on the fields of valor. When I journeyed to the stark white province, I was surprised to find a people whose views on Akatosh are almost diametrically opposed to those of the Altmer. The majority of Nord people seem to believe that their Alduin of legend is not Akatosh, but another deity entirely. A great dragon, yes, but not the Great Dragon.\nDetermined to get to the heart of this matter, I consulted with several Nords, chief among them an old and respected clan chief by the name of Bjorn Much-Bloodied. And what surprised me most about those I talked to was not that they believed in Alduin instead of Akatosh, but that they recognized Alduin in addition to Akatosh. In fact, most children of Skyrim seem to view Akatosh in much the same way I do - he is, in fact, the Great Dragon. First among the Divines, perseverance personified and, more than anything, a force of supreme good in the world.\nAlduin, they claim, is something altogether different.\nWhether or not he is actually a deity remains in question, but the Alduin of Nord folklore is in fact a dragon, but one so ancient, and so powerful, he was dubbed the \"World Eater,\" and some accounts even have him devouring the souls of the dead to maintain his own power. Other stories revolve around Alduin acting as some sort of dragon king, uniting the other dragons in a war against mankind, until he was eventually defeated at the hands of one or more brave heroes.\nIt is hard to deny that such legends are compelling. But as both High Priest and scholar, I am forced to ask that most important of questions - where is the evidence?\nThe Nords of Skyrim place a high value on their oral traditions, but such is the core of their unreliability. A rumor passed around the Wayrest market square can change so dramatically in the course of a few simple hours, that by the end of the day, one might believe half the city's residents were involved in any number of scandalous activities. How then is an educated, enlightened person possibly supposed to believe a legend that has been passed down, by word of mouth only, for hundreds, or even thousands of years?\nThe answer to such a question is simple - he cannot.\nAnd so, it is my conclusion that the Alduin of Nord legend is in fact mighty Akatosh, whose story grew twisted and deformed through centuries of retelling and embellishment. Through no real fault of their own, the primitive peoples of Skyrim failed to understand the goodness and greatness of the Great Dragon, and it was this lack of understanding that formed the basis of what became, ironically, their most impressive creative achievement - \"Alduin,\" the World Eater,  phantom of bedtime stories and justification for ancient (if imagined deeds)."

    "text": "In the first years of the First Era, a powerful race of Elves called the Ayleids, or the Heartland High Elves, ruled central Tamriel with an iron hand. The high and haughty Ayleids relied on their patrons, the treacherous Daedra Lords, to provide armies of daedra and dead spirits; with these fearless magical armies, the Ayleids preyed without mercy upon the young races of men, slaughtering or enslaving them at their whim.\nOn behalf of the suffering human races, St. Alessia, the first in the line of Cyrodiils, sought the aid of Akatosh, the Dragon God of Time, and ruler of the noble Aedra. Akatosh, looking with pity upon the plight of men, drew precious blood from his own heart, and blessed St. Alessia with this blood of Dragons, and made a Covenant that so long as Alessia's generations were true to the dragon blood, Akatosh would endeavor to seal tight the Gates of Oblivion, and to deny the armies of daedra and undead to their enemies, the Daedra-loving Ayleids.\nIn token of this Covenant, Akatosh gave to Alessia and her descendants the Amulet of Kings and the Eternal Dragonfires of the Imperial City. Thus does Alessia become the first gem in the Cyrodilic Amulet of Kings. The gem is the Red Diamond in the middle of the Amulet. This is the Symbol of the Empire and later taken as the symbol of the Septim line. It is surrounded by eight other gems, one for each of the divines.\nSo long as the Empire shall maintain its worship of Akatosh and his kin, and so long as Alessia's heirs shall bear the Amulet of Kings, Akatosh and his divine kin maintain a strong barrier between Tamriel and Oblivion, so that mortal man need never again fear the devastating summoned hosts of the Daedra Lords.\nBut if the Empire should slacken in its dedication to the Nine Divines, or if the blood of Alessia's heirs should fail, then shall the barriers between Tamriel and the Daedric realms fall, and Daedra-worshippers might summon lesser Daedra and undead spirits to trouble the races of men.\n"

    "text": "The Daedra are powerful ancestor spirits, similar in form and substance to the Tribunal (Blessed Be Their Holy Names), but weaker in power, and more arbitrary and removed from the affairs of mortals. In old times, the Chimer worshiped the Daedra as gods. But they did not deserve this veneration, for the Daedra harm their worshippers as often as help them.\nThe Advent of the Tribunal (Blessed Be Their Holy Names) changed this unhappy state. By the Apotheosis, the Tribunal (Blessed Be Their Holy Names) became the Protectors and High Ancestor Spirits of the Dunmer, and bade the Daedra to give proper veneration and obedience. The Three Good Daedra, Boethiah, Azura, and Mephala, recognized the Divinity of the Triune Ancestors (Blessed Be Their Holy Names). The Rebel Daedra, Molag Bal, Malacath, Sheogorath, and Mehrunes Dagon, refused to swear fealty to the Tribunal (Blessed Be Their Holy Names), and their worshippers were cast out.\nThese Rebel Daedra thus became the Four Corners of the House of Troubles, and they continue to plague our tranquility and tempt the unwary into Heresy and Dark Worship. The Priests of the Temple remain ever vigilant for signs of the Adversaries' return, sometimes aided by the loyal Three Good Daedra, who are familiar with the wiles of their rebellious kin.\nThe Good Daedra are known to the Temple as the Anticipations, since they are the early ancestral anticipations of the loving patronage of the Tribunal. The Anticipations are the Daedra Lords Boethiah, Mephala, and Azura.\nBoethiah is the Anticipation of Almalexia but male to her female. Boethiah was the ancestor who illuminated the elves ages ago before the Mythic Era. He told them the truth of Lorkhan's test, and defeated Auriel's champion, Trinimac. Boethiah ate Trinimac and voided him. The followers of Boethiah and Trinimac rubbed the soil of Trinimac upon themselves and changed their skins.\nMephala is the Anticipation of Vivec, but manifold and androgynous. Mephala taught the Chimer to evade their enemies or kill them with secret murder. Enemies were numerous in those days since the Chimer were a small with enemies on all sides. Mephala organized the clan systems that eventually became the Great Houses. Later, Mephala created the Morag Tong.\nAzura is the Anticipation of Sotha Sil, but female to his male. Azura was the ancestor who taught the Chimer how to be different from the Altmer. Her teachings are sometimes attributed to Boethiah. In the stories, Azura is often encountered more as a communal progenitor of the race as a whole rather than as an individual ancestor. She is associated with Dusk and Dawn, and is sometimes called the Mother Soul. Azura's Star, also called the Twilight Star, appears briefly at dawn and dusk low on the horizon below the constellation of the Steed. Azura is associated with mystery and magic, fate and prophecy."

    "text": "The Apprentice's Assistant\nAdvice from Valenwood's most prestigious spellcaster\n\nNo doubt you have heard tales of my adventures. Stories carried from province to province, all of Tamriel in awe of my feats of magical prowess. More than once, I am sure, you have thought \"if only I had Aramril's ability. Then I too could seek fame and fortune in magic duels!\"\nIt is true, of course. Great fame and limitless fortune await those who are successful. But to be successful, one needs to learn from the best. That is why you have purchased this book, so that I may teach you. I am, of course, the best.\nHere, then, is my advice. Follow it, and you too can make a name for yourself throughout Tamriel.\n1. To know your opponent is to know his weakness.\nInfinitely more versatile than a simple blade of steel, a good mage has a wide array of spells at her disposal. More than that, she knows when to best use them. She knows that frost spells can stop a charging beast, or keep a savage brute from swinging his sword. She knows that shock spells can drain her opponent's magicka. She knows that illusion spells can set a group of enemies against each other (should she find herself in a less than fair fight, an all-too-common reality when her opponents know they cannot win in single combat) and that there are spells that can save her in a moment when all seems lost.\n2. To know yourself is to know your limits.\nEven the best mage has a finite reserve of magicka; none born yet have been graced with Magnus' infinite reserves of power. And so a good mage does not over-extend herself. She makes sure she always has enough magicka to keep herself safe. Failing that, she makes sure she has a sizable supply of potions at the ready. Failing that, she makes sure she always has an escape route. Not that the Great Aramril has ever fled a fight, but of course you do not necessarily share her superb natural ability. That is why you must practice.\n3. Wards can kill (you)\nThere is no question that wards are an essential tool of any aspiring mage. They can block incoming spells, negating your opponent's attack and wasting his magicka. A good mage knows, however, to not rely too heavily on her ward. Keeping a ward readied for too long will leave a caster drained of magicka, unable to retaliate, and at worst unable to maintain the ward and therefore completely defenseless.\n4. Two hands are not always better than one\nAny advanced spellcaster has learned to cast spells with both hands, dealing more damage. There are certainly times when this is to your advantage, such as when an opponent is already weakened, or when it is likely to draw a bigger reaction from the crowd that has no doubt gathered to watch you. It is not always the best strategy, however. Concentration spells, for example, can often be used on the ground when an opponent is especially nimble. In that instance, using both hands independently can cover more ground at the same time. A mage throwing fireballs with both hands cannot immediately raise a ward to defend herself, or heal while she continues to attack.\n5. Always rise to a challenge, especially when you know you can win\nRemember that your first priority is, of course, to stay alive. Following closely behind, though, is your need to please the crowd. You are, after all, depending on their generosity to fund your adventures. Here, then, more than magic comes into play. If you can gain a sense of your opponent's ability before the duel begins, you can enter into the event with confidence. Knowing that you outclass your opponent is of great importance, as it means you can confidently give the crowd a better show. Likewise, knowing ahead of time that you could very well lose a duel, you are afforded an opportunity to suddenly find yourself engaged elsewhere, and be unable to attend the event. (By no means do I suggest that I have ever done such a thing; I simply find that my great fame occasionally means I am unable to respond to every single request for a duel)\nKeep these few things in mind, keep your wits about you, and you too can make a name for yourself by putting on great displays of magical prowess. Take care, though - for if you become successful enough, you may find yourself facing a challenge from me!\n"

    "description": "The story of the devlopment of a Morag Tong assassin who exclusively used the axe during business hours. Raises your Axe skill.",
    "text": "Of all the members of the Morag Tong I've spoken with, none disturbed me as much as Minas Torik. A quiet and reserved man who never drank, never visited a brothel or even uttered a curse, he was famous for his ability to make people disappear. Once a person was targeted by the Brotherhood and Torik was sent to them, they would simply cease to be. I asked him once what his weapon of choice was, and was equally startled by his answer.\n“I only likes to use axes,” he said in his typical, quiet voice.\nThe image of this silent, dour fellow attacking anyone with a weapon as inherently bloody and violent as an axe so frightened and intrigued me that I questioned him about it further. This is an inherently dangerous activity, for assassins are not typically keen to give out their stories. Torik did not mind the questions, though it took some time to get the full story out of him, as naturally shy and reserved as he was.\nIt seemed that Torik had been orphaned as a very young age and sent to live with his uncle, a saltrice plantation owner in Sheogorad in northern Vvardenfell. The man promised to show his nephew the business and eventually make him a partner when he was old enough. In the meantime, the boy was put to work as his uncle's house servant.\nIt was a grueling life as the old man was very particular about how things should be done. The boy was first required to give all the floors in the house a thorough scouring, from the attic to the cellar. Whenever the floor was not cleaned to the uncle's satisfaction, which was frequent, Torik was thrashed and forced to begin again.\nThe boy's second duty was to ring the bell that would bring the laborers into the house. This was done at least four times a day, once for each meal, but if his uncle had any news or additional instructions for the laborers -- which he frequently did -- the bell might need to be sounded a dozen times or more. It was a huge iron bell in the tower and the boy quickly discovered that he had to throw his entire body into the motion of pulling the chain in order to have it sound loud enough to bring everyone in from the field. If he was tired and did not pull the backbreaking chain hard enough, his uncle was soon at his side to beat him until he rang the bell loud and clear.\nTorik's third task was dusting all the shelves in his uncle's vast library. As deep and old as the shelves were, he was required to work with a long, heavy duster on a rod. The only way that he could reach to the back of the shelves was to hold the duster at his shoulder and then swing it out in a sweeping motion. Again, if the uncle saw any dust left over or felt that the boy was not working as hard as he ought to, the punishment was swift and severe.\nAfter several years, Minas Torik grew into a young man, but his job responsibilities were not increased. His uncle promised to teach him the business, once Torik had demonstrated his mastery of his servile assignments. Divorced from any knowledge of any work other than his own, Torik never knew how badly in debt his uncle was and how poorly the farm's yield was.\nIn his eighteenth year, Torik was called into the cellar by his uncle. He thought that he had not done a good enough job scouring the floor down there, and was frightened of the beating to come. What he found, however, was his uncle packing his goods into crates.\n“I'm leaving Morrowind,” he explained. “The business has gone sour, so I thought I'd try my luck running a caravan in Skyrim. I understand there's good money to be made, trading fake Dwemer artifacts to the Nords and Cyrodiils. I wish I could take you with me, my lad, but there won't be much need for scouring, bell pulling, and dusting where I'm going.”\n“But uncle,” said Torik. “I can't read, I knows nothing of the business you promised to teach me. What wills I dos on my own?”\n“I'm certain you can find a job in some domestic capacity,” shrugged the uncle. “I've done my best with you.”\nTorik had never stood up to his uncle before, and felt no anger only a sort of coldness that gripped his heart. Among his uncle's possessions being packed away was an old heavy iron axe, allegedly of Dwemer manufacture. He picked it up in his hands and was surprised to find that it was not much heavier than his dusting rod. In fact, it felt very comfortable as he pulled it over his shoulder and swung it out as he had done so many times before. In this instance, however, he swung it into his uncle's right arm.\nThe old man screamed with pain and rage, but for some reason, Torik didn't feel frightened anymore. He propped the axe against his other shoulder, and swung it out again. It cut a swath across the old man's chest and he fell to the floor.\nTorik hesitated before lifting the axe above his head. It was another natural position for him, like he was ringing a bell. Over and over again, he swung down as if he was calling the laborers in from the field. Except that this time, there was no sound except for a wet thump, and no laborers came in from the field. Of course, his uncle had sent them away hours before.\nAfter a time, there was nothing left of his uncle that couldn't be washed down the cellar drain. The process of cleaning up came easily to Torik as well. Blood scrubbed up much quicker than the usual grime and saltrice flour that littered the cellar floor.\nIt was well known that Torik's uncle was planning to leave Morrowind, so his disappearance provoked no suspicion. The house and all the belongings were sold to the debt collectors, but Torik took the axe. It seemed that his uncle had given him some worthwhile business skills after all."

    "text": "The Bear of Markarth\nThe Crimes of Ulfric Stormcloak\nby\nArrianus Arius\nImperial Scholar\n\nUlfric Stormcloak is considered a hero by many for his part in quelling the Forsworn Uprising. It is said that when the Empire abandoned Skyrim, and the natives of the Reach rebelled (undoubtedly due to the Nords poor treatment of them), Ulfric Stormcloak and his militia was there to retake \"their\" land from the Forsworn. In all the bravado and epic yarns the skalds compose of his exploits, you would think Ulfric to be a giant of a man, equal to that of Tiber Septim in his cunning, leadership, and decisive actions.\nBut the truth is far more revealing. Yes, from 4E 174-176, the Forsworn did in fact rule over the Reach as an independent kingdom from Skyrim. Yes, this was accomplished while the Empire was beset by Aldmeri Dominion forces and could not send the Legion to re-establish order. And yes, Ulfric Stormcloak did quell the rebellion without Imperial assistance. That much is true, but what the bards often fail to tell in their stories is that the Forsworn Kingdom was quite peaceful for those 2 years they were in power.\nTrue, some crimes were committed against former Nord landowners (often those accused of being the harshest towards their native workers), but on the whole the Forsworn ruled their lands fairly, and were making overtures to be recognized by the Empire as a legitimate kingdom.\nIn the wake of the aftermath of the Great War, you can imagine the backlog on stately matters the Empire had. Before a peace treaty could be resolved with the Forsworn, a militia led by Ulfric Stormcloak sieged the gates of their capital, Markarth. What happened during that battle was war, but what happened after the battle was over is nothing short of war crimes.\nEvery official who worked for the Forsworn was put to the sword, even after they had surrendered. Native women were tortured to give up names of Forsworn fighters who had fled the city or were in the hills of the Reach. Anyone who lived in the city, Forsworn and Nord alike, were executed if they had not fought with Ulfric and his men when they breached the gates. \"You are with us, or you are against Skyrim\" was the message on Ulfric's lips as he ordered the deaths of shopkeepers, farmers, the elderly, and any child old enough to lift a sword that  had failed in the call to fight with him.\nSo when a \"grateful\" Empire accepted Ulfric's victory and sent soldiers to re-establish the rule of law in the Reach, it was no surprise that he would demand to be allowed to worship Talos freely before the Legion could enter. With chaos running through the streets of Markarth and the reports of deaths rising every day, the Empire had no choice but to grant Ulfric and his men their worship.\nWe allowed them to worship Talos, in full violation of the White-Gold Concordat with the Aldmeri Dominion (which recognizes the elven belief that Talos, as a human, cannot be one of the Divines). In jeopardizing the treaty that so many sacrificed for during the Great War, the Empire was wrong. But what choice did they have, I ask you? Against the Bear of Markarth, Ulfric Stormcloak, \"no\" is not an answer."

    "text": "The Black Arrow, v1\nThe Black Arrow\nPart I\nby \nGorgic Guine\nI was young when the Duchess of Woda hired me as an assistant footman at her summer palace. My experience with the ways of the titled aristocracy was very limited before that day. There were wealthy merchants, traders, diplomats, and officials who had large operations in Eldenroot, and ostentatious palaces for entertaining, but my relatives were all far from those social circles.\nThere was no family business for me to enter when I reached adulthood, but my cousin heard that an estate far from the city required servants. It was so remotely located that there were unlikely to be many applicants for the positions. I walked for five days into the jungles of Valenwood before I met a group of riders going my direction. They were three Bosmer men, one Bosmer woman, two Breton women, and a Dunmer man, adventurers from the look of them.\n\"Are you also going to Moliva?\" asked Prolyssa, one of the Breton women, after we had made our introductions.\n\"I don't know what that is,\" I replied. \"I'm seeking a domestic position with the Duchess of Woda.\"\n\"We'll take you to her gate,\" said the Dunmer Missun Akin, pulling me up to his horse. \"But you would be wise not to tell Her Grace that students from Moliva escorted you. Not unless you don't really want the position in her service.\"\nAkin explained himself as we rode on. Moliva was the closest village to the Duchess's estate, where a great and renowned archer had retired after a long life of military service. His name was Hiomaste, and though he was retired, he had begun to accept students who wished to learn the art of the bow. In time, when word spread of the great teacher, more and more students arrived to learn from the Master. The Breton women had come down all the way from the Western Reach of High Rock. Akin himself had journeyed across the continent from his home near the great volcano in Morrowind. He showed me the ebony arrows he had brought from his homeland. I had never seen anything so black.\n\"From what we've heard,\" said Kopale, one of the Bosmer men. \"The Duchess is an Imperial whose family has been here even before the Empire was formed, so you might think that she was accustomed to the common people of Valenwood. Nothing could be further from the truth. She despises the village, and the school most of all.\"\n\"I suppose she wants to control all the traffic in her jungle,\" laughed Prolyssa.\nI accepted the information with gratitude, and found myself dreading more and more my first meeting with the intolerant Duchess. My first sight of the palace through the trees did nothing to assuage my fears.\nIt was nothing like any building I had ever seen in Valenwood. A vast edifice of stone and iron, with a jagged row of battlements like the jaws of a great beast. Most of the trees near the palace had been hewn away long ago: I could only imagine the scandal that must have caused, and what fear the Bosmer peasants must have had of the Duchy of Woda to have allowed it. In their stead was a wide gray-green moat circling in a ring around the palace, so it seemed to be on a perfect if artificial island. I had seen such sights in tapestries from High Rock and the Imperial Province, but never in my homeland.\n\"There'll be a guard at the gate, so we'll leave you here,\" said Akin, stopping his horse in the road. \"It'd be best for you if you weren't damned by association with us.\"\nI thanked my companions, and wished them good luck with their schooling. They rode on and I followed on foot. In a few minutes' time, I was at the front gate, which I noticed was linked to tall and ornate railings to keep the compound secure. When the gate-keeper understood that I was there to inquire about a domestic position, he allowed me past and signaled to another guard across the open lawn to extend the drawbridge and allow me to cross the moat.\nThere was one last security measure: the front door. An iron monstrosity with the Woda Coat of Arms across the top, reinforced by more strips of iron, and a single golden keyhole. The man standing guard unlocked the door and gave me passage into the huge gloomy gray stone palace.\nHer Grace greeted me in her drawing room. She was thin and wrinkled like a reptile, cloaked in a simple red gown. It was obviously that she never smiled. Our interview consisted of a single question.\n\"Do you know anything about being a junior footman in the employment of an Imperial noblewoman?\" Her voice was like ancient leather.\n\"No, Your Grace.\"\n\"Good. No servant ever understands what needs to be done, and I particularly dislike those who think they do. You're engaged.\"\nLife at the palace was joyless, but the position of junior footman was very undemanding. I had nothing to do on most days except to stay out of the Duchess's sight. At such times, I usually walked two miles down the road to Moliva. In some ways, there was nothing special or unusual about the village - there are thousands of identical places in Valenwood. But on the hillside nearby was Master Hiomaste's archery academy, and I would often take my luncheon and watch the practice.\nProlyssa and Akin would sometimes meet me afterwards. With Akin, the subjects of conversation very seldom strayed far from archery. Though I was very fond of him, I found Prolyssa a more enchanting companion, not only because she was pretty for a Breton, but also because she seemed to have interests outside the realm of marksmanship.\n\"There's a circus in High Rock I saw when I was a little girl called the Quill Circus,\" she said during one of our walks through the woods. \"They've been around for as long as anyone can remember. You have to see them if you ever can. They have plays, and sideshows, and the most amazing acrobats and archers you've ever seen. That's my dream, to join them some day when I'm good enough.\"\n\"How will you know when you're a good enough archer?\" I asked.\nShe didn't answer, and when I turned, I realized that she had disappeared. I looked around, bewildered, until I heard laughter from the tree above me. She was perched on a branch, grinning.\n\"I may not join as an archer, maybe I'll join as an acrobat,\" she said. \"Or maybe as both. I figured that Valenwood would be the place to go to see what I could learn. You've got all those great teachers to imitate in the trees here. Those ape men.\"\nShe coiled up, bracing her left leg before springing forward on her right. In a second, she had leapt across to a neighboring branch. I found it difficult to keep talking to her.\n\"The Imga, you mean?\" I stammered. \"Aren't you nervous up at that height?\"\n\"It's a cliche, I know,\" she said, jumping to an even higher branch, \"But the secret is not to ever look down.\"\n\"Would you mind coming down?\"\n\"I probably should anyhow,\" she said. She was a good thirty feet up now, balancing herself, arms outstretched, on a very narrow branch. She gestured toward the gate just barely visible on the other side of the road. \"This tree is actually as close as I want to get to your Duchess's palace.\"\nI held back a gasp as she dove off the branch, somersaulting until she landed on the ground, knees slightly bent. That was the trick, she explained. Anticipating the blow before it happened.  I expressed to her my confidence that she would be a great attraction at the Quill Circus. Of course, I know now that never was to be.\nOn that day, as I recall, I had to return early. It was one of the rare occasions when I had work, of a sort, to do. Whenever the Duchess had guests, I was to be at the palace. That is not to say that I had any particular duties, except to be seen standing at attention in the dining room. The stewards and maids worked hard to bring in the food and clear the plates afterwards, but the footmen were purely decorative, a formality.\nBut at least I was an audience for the drama to come.\n\nThe Black Arrow, v2\nThe Black Arrow\nPart II\nBy\nGorgic Guine\n\nOn the last dinner in my employ at the palace, the Duchess, quite surprisingly, had invited the mayor of Moliva and Master Hiomaste himself among her other guests. The servants' gossip was manic. The mayor had been there before, albeit very irregularly, but Hiomaste's presence was unthinkable. What could she mean by such a conciliatory gesture?\nThe dinner itself progressed along with perfect if slightly cool civility among all parties. Hiomaste and the Duchess were both very quiet. The Mayor tried to engage the group in a discussion of the Emperor Pelagius IV's new son and heir Uriel, but it failed to spark much interest. Lady Villea, elderly but much more vivacious than her sister the Duchess, led most of the talk about crime and scandal in Eldenroot.\n\"I have been encouraging her to move out to the country, away from all that unpleasantness for years now,\" the Duchess said, meeting the eyes of the Mayor. \"We've been discussing more recently the possibility of her building a palace on Moliva Hill, but there's so little space there as you know. Fortunately, we've come to a discovery. There is a wide field just a few days west, on the edge of the river, ideally suited.\"\n\"It sounds perfect,\" the Mayor smiled and turned to Lady Villea: \"When will your ladyship begin building?\"\n\"The very day you move your village to the site,\" replied the Duchess of Woda.\nThe Mayor turned to her to see if she was joking. She obviously was not.\n\"Think of how much more commerce you could bring to your village if you were close to the river,\" said Lady Villea jovially. \"And Master Hiomaste's students could have easier access to his fine school. Everyone would benefit. I know it would put my sister's heart to ease if there was less trespassing and poaching on her lands.\"\n\"There is no poaching or trespassing on your lands now, Your Grace,\" frowned Hiomaste. \"You do not own the jungle, nor will you. The villagers may be persuaded to leave, that I don't know. But my school will stay where it is.\"\nThe dinner party never really recovered happily. Hiomaste and the Mayor excused themselves, and my services, such as they were, were not needed in the drawing room where the group went to have their drinks. There was no laughter to be heard through the walls that evening.\nThe next day, even though there was a dinner planned for the evening, I left on my usual walk to Moliva. Before I had even reached the drawbridge, the guard held me back: \"Where are you going, Gorgic? Not to the village, are you?\"\n\"Why not?\"\nHe pointed to the plume of smoke in the distance: \"A fire broke out very early this morning, and it's still going. Apparently, it started at Master Hiomaste's school. It looks like the work of some traveling brigands.\"\n\"Blessed Stendarr!\" I cried. \"Are the students alive?\"\n\"No one knows, but it'd be a miracle if any survived. It was late and most everyone was sleeping. I know they've already found the Master's body, or what was left of it. And they also found that girl, your friend, Prolyssa.\"\nI spent the day in a state of shock. It seemed inconceivable what my instinct told me: that the two noble old ladies, Lady Villea and the Duchess of Woda, had arranged for a village and school that irritated them to be reduced to ashes. At dinner, they mentioned the fire in Moliva only very briefly, as if it were not news at all. But I did see the Duchess smile for the first time ever. It was a smile I will never forget until the day I die.\nThe next morning, I had resolved to go to the village and see if I could be of any assistance to the survivors. I was passing through the servants' hall to the grand foyer when I heard the sound of a group of people ahead. The guards and most of the servants were there, pointing at the portrait of the Duchess that hung in the center of the hall.\nThere was a single black bolt of ebony piercing the painting, right at the Duchess's heart.\nI recognized it at once. It was one of Missun Akin's arrows I had seen in his quiver, forged, he said, in the bowels of Dagoth-Ur itself. My first reaction was relief: the Dunmer who had been kind enough to give me a ride to the palace had survived the fire. My second reaction was echoed by all present in the hall. How had the vandal gotten past the guards, the gate, the moat, and the massive iron door?\nThe Duchess, arriving shortly after I, was clearly furious, though she was too well bred to show it but by raising her web-thin eyebrows. She wasted no time in assigning all her servants to new duties to keep the palace grounds guarded at all times. We were given regular shifts and precise, narrow patrols.\nThe next morning, despite all precautions, there was another black arrow piercing the Duchess's portrait.\nSo it continued for a week's time. The Duchess saw to it that at least one person was always present in the foyer, but somehow the arrow always found its way to her painting whenever the guard's eyes were momentarily averted.\nA complex series of signals were devised, so each patrol could report back any sounds or disturbances they encountered during their vigil. At first, the Duchess arranged them so her castellan would receive record of any disturbances during the day, and the chief of the guard during the night. But when she found that she could not sleep, she made certain that the information came to her directly.\nThe atmosphere in the palace had shifted from gloomy to nightmarish. A snake would slither across the moat, and suddenly Her Grace would be tearing through the east wing to investigate. A strong gust of wind ruffling the leaves on one of the few trees in the lawn was a similar emergency. An unfortunate lone traveler on the road in front of the palace, a completely innocent man at it turned out, brought such a violent reaction that he must have thought that he had stumbled on a war. In a way, he had.\nAnd every morning, there was a new arrow in the front hall, mocking her.\nI was given the terrible assignment of guarding the portrait for a few hours in the early morning. Not wanting to be the one to discover the arrow, I seated myself in a chair opposite, never letting my eyes move away for even a second. I don't know if you've had the experience of watching one object relentlessly, but it has a strange effect. All other senses vanish. That was why I was particularly startled when the Duchess rushed into the room, blurring the gulf for me between her portrait and herself.\n\"There's something moving behind the tree across the road from the gate!\" she roared, pushing me aside, and fumbling with her key in the gold lock.\nShe was shaking with madness and excitement, and the key did not seem to want to go in. I reached out to help her, but the Duchess was already kneeling, her eye to the keyhole, to be certain that the key went through.\nIt was precisely in that second that the arrow arrived, but this one never made it as far as the portrait.\nI actually met Missun Akin years later, while I was in Morrowind to entertain some nobles. He was impressed that I had risen from being a humble domestic servant to being a bard of some renown. He himself had returned to the ashlands, and, like his old master Hiomaste, was retired to the simple life of teaching and hunting.\nI told him that I had heard that Lady Villea had decided not to leave the city, and that the village of Modiva had been rebuilt. He was happy to hear that, but I could not find a way to ask him what I really wanted to know. I felt like a fool just wondering if what I thought were true, that he had been behind Prolyssa's tree across the road from the gate every morning that summer, firing an arrow through the gate, across the lawn, across the moat, through a keyhole, and into a portrait of the Duchess of Woda until he struck the Duchess herself. It was clearly an impossibility. I chose not to ask.\nAs we left one another that day, and he was waving good-bye, he said, \"I am pleased to see you doing so well, my friend. I am happy you moved that chair.\"\n"

    "description": "A history of the Morag Tong and Dark Brotherhood",
    "text": "As their name suggests, the Dark Brotherhood has a history shrouded in obfuscation. Their ways are secret to those who are not themselves Brothers of the Order (\"Brother\" is a generic term; some of their deadliest assassins are female, but they are often called Brothers as well). How they continue to exist in shadow, but be easily found by those desperate enough to pay for their services, is not the least of the mysteries surrounding them.\nThe Dark Brotherhood sprang from a religious order, the Morag Tong, during the Second Era. The Morag Tong were worshippers of the Daedra spirit Mephala, who encouraged them to commit ritual murders. In their early years, they were as disorganized as only obscure cultists could be-there was no one to lead the band, and as a group they dared not murder anybody of any importance. This changed with the rise of the Night Mother.\nAll leaders of the Morag Tong, and then afterward the Dark Brotherhood, have been called the Night Mother. Whether the same woman (if it is even a woman) has commanded the Dark Brotherhood since the Second Era is unknown. What is believed is that the original Night Mother developed an important doctrine of the Morag Tong-the belief that, while Mephala does grow stronger with every murder committed in her name, certain murders were better than others. Murders that came from hate pleased Mephala more than murders committed because of greed. Murders of great men and women pleased Mephala more than murders of relative unknowns.\nWe can approximate the time this belief was adopted with the first known murder committed by the Morag Tong. In the year 324 of the Second Era, the Potentate Versidue-Shaie was murdered in his palace in what is today the Elsweyr kingdom of Senchal. In a brash move, the Night Mother announced the identity of the murderers by painting \"MORAG TONG\" on the walls in the Potentate's own blood.\nPrevious to that, the Morag Tong existed in relative peace, more or less like a witches' coven-occasionally persecuted but usually ignored. In remarkable synchronicity at a time when Tamriel the Arena was a fractured land, the Morag Tong was outlawed throughout the continent. Every sovereign gave the cult's elimination his highest priority. Nothing more was officially heard of them for a hundred years.\nIt is more difficult to date the Era when the Morag Tong re-emerged as the Dark Brotherhood, especially as other guilds of assassins have sporadically appeared throughout the history of Tamriel. The first mention of the Dark Brotherhood that I have found is from the journals of the Blood Queen Arlimahera of Hegathe. She spoke of slaying her enemies by her own hand, or if necessary \"with the help of the Night Mother and her Dark Brotherhood, the secret arsenal my family has employed since my grandfather's time.\" Arlimahera wrote this in 2E412, so one can surmise that the Dark Brotherhood had been in existence since at least 360 if her grandfather had truly made use of them.\nThe important distinction between the Dark Brotherhood and the Morag Tong was that the Brotherhood was a business as much as it was a cult. Rulers and wealthy merchants used the order as an assassin's guild. The Brotherhood gained the obvious rewards of a profitable enterprise, as well as the secondary benefit that rulers could no longer actively persecute them: They were needed. They were purveyors of an essential commodity. Even an extremely virtuous leader would be unwise to mistreat the Brotherhood.\nNot long after Alimahera's journal entry came perhaps the most famous series of executions in the history of the Dark Brotherhood. The Colovian Emperor-Potentate Savirien-Chorak and every one of his heirs were murdered on one bloody night in Sun's Dawn in 430. Within a fortnight, the Colovian Dynasty crumbled, to the delight of its enemies. For over four hundred years, until the advent of the Warrior Emperor Tiber Septim, chaos reigned over Tamriel. Though no comparably impressive executions have been recorded, the Brotherhood must have grown fat with gold during that interregnum."

    "text": "\nI was in the Rat and the Pot, a foreigner cornerclub in Ald'ruhn, talking to my fellow Rats when I first saw the woman. Now, Breton women are fairly common in the Rat and the Pot: as a breed, they seem inclined to wander far from their perches in High Rock. Old Breton women, however, are not so migratory, and the wizened old biddy drew attention to herself, wandering about the room, talking to everyone. Still, having noted her, I moved on to join my mates.\nNimloth and Oediad were at their usual places, drinking their usual stuff. Oediad was showing off a prize he had picked up in some illicit manner -- a colossal diamond, large as a baby's hand, and clear as spring water. I was admiring it when I heard the creaking of old bones behind me.\n\"Good day to you, friends,\" said the old woman. \"My name is Abelle Chriditte, and I am in need of financial assistance to facilitate my transportation to Ald Redaynia.\"\n\"You'll want to see the Temple for charity,\" said Nimloth curtly.\n\"I am not looking for charity,\" said Abelle. \"I'm looking to barter  services.\"\n\"Don't make me sick, old woman,\" laughed Oediad.\n\"Did you say your name was Abelle Chriditte?\" I asked, \"Are you related to Abelle Chriditte, the High Rock alchemist?\"\n\"Extremely related,\" she said, with a cackle. \"We are the same person. Perhaps I could prepare you a potion in exchange for gold? I noticed that you have in your possession a very fine diamond. The magical qualities of diamonds are boundless.\"\n\"Sorry, old woman, I ain't giving it up for magic. It was trouble enough stealing this one,\" said Oediad. \"I've got a fence who'll trade it for gold.\"\n\"But your fence will demand a certain percentage, will he not? What if I could give you a potion of invisibility in exchange? In return for that diamond, you could have the means to steal many more. A very fair exchange of services, I would say.\"\n\"It would be, but I have no gold to give you,\" said Oediad.\n\"I'll take what remains of the diamond after I've made the potion,\" said Abelle. \"If you took it to the Mages Guild, you'd have to supply all the other ingredients and pay for it as well. But I learned my craft in the wild, where no Potion-makers existed to dissolve diamonds into dust. When you must do it all by hand, by simple skill, you are blessed with remnants those fool potion-makers at the Guild simply swallow up.\"\n\"That sounds all very nice,\" said Nimloth, \"But how do we know your potion is going to work? If you make one potion, take the rest of Oediad's diamond, and leave, we won't know until you've gone whether the potion works or not.\"\n\"Ah, trust is so rare these days,\" sighed Abelle. \"I suppose I could make two potions for you, and there'd still be a little bit of the diamond left for me. Not a lot, but perhaps enough to get me to Ald Redaynia. Then you could try the first potion right here and now, and see if you're satisfied or not.\"\n\"But,\" I interjected. \"You could make one potion that works and one that doesn't, and take more of the diamond. She could even give you a slow-acting poison, and by the time she got to Ald Redaynia, you'd be dead.\"\n\"Bleedin' Kynareth, you Dunmer are suspicious! I will hardly have any diamond left, but I could make two potions of two doses each, so you can satisfy yourself that the potion works and has no negative effects. If you still don't trust me, come along with me to my table and witness my craft if you'd like.\"\nSo it was decided that I would accompany Abelle back to her table where she had all her traveling bags full of herbs and minerals, to make certain that she was not making two different potions. It took nearly an hour of preparation, but she kindly allowed me to finish her half-filled flagon of wine while I watched her work.  Splintering the diamond and powdering the pieces required the bulk of the time; over and over again, she waved her gnarled hands over the gem, intoning ancient enchantments, breaking the facets of the stone into smaller and smaller pieces. Separately she made pastes of minced bittergreen, crushed red bulbs of dell'arco spae, and driblets of ciciliani oil. I finished the wine.\n\"Old woman,\" I finally said with a sigh. \"How much longer is this going to take? I'm getting tired of watching you work.\"\n\"The Mages Guild has fooled the populace into thinking alchemy is a science,\" she said. \"But if you're tired, rest your eyes.\"\nMy eyes closed, seemingly of their own volition. But there had been something in that wine. Something that made me do what she asked.\n\"I think I'll make up the potion as cakes. It's much more potent that way. Now, tell me, young man, what will your friends do once I give them the potion?\"\n\"Mug you in the street afterwards to retrieve the rest of the diamond,\" I said simply. I didn't want to tell the truth, but there it was.\n\"I thought so, but I wanted to be certain. You may open your eyes now.\"\nI opened my eyes. Abelle had made a small presentation on a wooden platter: two small cakes and a silver cutting knife.\n\"Pick up the cakes and bring them to the table,\" said Abelle. \"And don't say anything, except to agree with whatever I say.\"\nI did as I was told. It was a curious sensation. I didn't really mind being her puppet. Of course, in retrospect, I resent it, but it seemed perfectly natural at the time to obey without question.\nAbelle handed the cakes to Oediad and I dutifully verified that both cakes were made the same way. She suggested that he cut one of the cakes in half, and she would take one piece and he'd take the other, just so he would know that they worked and weren't poisoned. Oediad thought it was a good idea, and used Abelle's knife to cut the cake. Abelle took the piece on the left and popped into her mouth. Oediad took the piece on the right and swallowed it more cautiously.\nAbelle and all the bags she was carrying vanished from sight almost instantly. Nothing happened to Oediad.\n\"Why did it work for the witch and not for me?\" cried Oediad.\n\"Because the diamond dust was only on the left-hand side of the blade,\" said the old alchemist through me. I felt her control lessening as the distance grew and she hurried invisibly down the dark Ald'ruhn street away from the Rat and the Pot.\nWe never found Abelle Chriditte or the diamond. Whether she completed her pilgrimage to Ald Redaynia is anyone's guess. The cakes had no effect, except to give Oediad a bad case of droops that lasted for nearly a week."

    "description": "A guide to Markarth, from the perspective of a mercenary.",
    "text": "The City of Stone:\nA Sellsword's Guide to Markarth\nby \nAmanda Alleia\nMercenary\n\nIf you're cutting your coins across Skyrim, you'll want to point your blade towards Markarth, the capital city of the Reach. There's no end of trouble in the City of Stone, and that means plenty of ways for you to earn your supper. Your sellsword instincts should point you towards the wealthiest patrons with the fattest purses to work for, but you need to mind yourself during your resting hours.\nMarkarth isn't like your Whiterun, where mercenary companies like the Companions make a sellsword an honored professional. No, Markarth has its own rules, rules the natives aren't going to just tell you. Lucky for you, old Ms. Alleia is here to shine the torchlight over your thick skulls.\nFirst thing you'll notice in the City of Stone is... the stone. They say dwarves cut out the city from the mountain, and maybe they did by the look of it. But what it really means is that the whole place is vertical, and the streets are really cliffs. Long story short, be careful when you've got a bellyful of mead.\nWhen you enter the city proper, you'll immediately hit the market. The merchants usually sell food and jewelry on the streets. Meat is the preferred ration, the craggy rocks in the area make for poor farming land, and silver is what's used to make most all the rings and necklaces you might by, thanks to the large silver mine in the city (we'll get to that in a bit).\nWhatever you do, don't ask the Markarth city guard about anything. They're about as helpful as an angry Frostbite Spider while you're caught in its web, and if you mention anything about the Forsworn to them they might spit in your eye. Speaking of the Forsworn, these wildmen and women will be your main source of income while you're in Markarth. The Jarl almost always has a bounty on some Forsworn leader or another, and if you don't mind going blade-to-axe with someone two septims short of a pint of ale, it's steady work.\nThe Silver-Blood Inn is where you want to head into after seeing the market. The drinks are, as usual, watered down (and judging by the metallic taste, with water from the rivers that run through the city's smelter district). What's important here is getting a room to stay in. You won't find any friendly faces to con your way into a cheap place to stay in Markarth. The natives don't trust strangers, so save yourself the trouble and put down your coin to rent a real room.\nAfter you've spent a day recovering from travel, you'll see that Markarth is divided in two sides by the big crag in the center. The part with the big river running through it is called the Riverside, and the other is called the Dryside. The Riverside is where the smelter and native workers live, so don't bother going there. Instead, head directly to Dryside and talk to the local Nord nobles and see what problems you can start solving (at the highest rate).\nTwo major places to see are the Temple of Dibella and Cidhna Mine. The temple rests on the top of the central crag. A good place to go if you're on good terms with the Divines, but be warned, the Priestesses of Dibella don't allow men into their Inner Sanctums, so don't go crashing down in there uninvited unless you want a short trip to a long fall.\nCidhna Mine is the place where all the silver comes from that I mentioned before. But it's also the jail. Markarth uses prisoners to mine the ore, and there's a lot of it, so don't get caught doing something illegal in the city or you'll be hauled down there to dig. Apparently, the whole place is owned by one of the big families in the city, the Silver-Bloods (notice the inn is named after them? Always keep your sellsword eye open for hints like that). I tried meeting with the head of the Silver-Blood family to see if they had any work, but guarding their mines isn't the blood-rush I become a mercenary for. Something to keep in mind for yourself if you're thinking of staying a few months.\nThe final place I'll talk about here is Understone Keep, the home of the Jarl in Markarth. It's a fancy palace like any other (assuming your palace is built underground), but what you need to know is the city underneath the keep. That's right, there's another city below Markarth. One of those old dwarven ruins. They sometimes have expeditions in the ruins that makes for a good job, guarding the scholars and maybe lifting a few stones here and there. If you're lucky, you might come across one of those old dwarven machines, and you can bring back a souvenir after you're done breaking it apart.\nAll right, Ms. Alleia's hand is getting tired and that means this guide is done. Last piece of advice, don't cause trouble in Markarth. Don't start fights. Don't stop fights. Don't stick your head anywhere without someone from the city paying you for it, because believe me, no one in Markarth wants you there. Make your gold, drink your mead, see what's there to see, and move on. Nothing changes in the City of Stone, and that's just fine."

    "text": "The Code of Malacath:\nA Sellsword's Guide to the Orc Strongholds\nby \nAmanda Alleia\nMercenary\n\n\"No one bests an Orc.\"\nI don't need you to guess how many times I've heard that boast in some dingy tavern or screamed at the top of the lungs by some fellow sellsword with too much fire in him. But I'd be lying if I said the Orc Strongholds don't take those words as law. There are few places where Ms. Alleia would tell you that \"tradition\" and the \"old ways\" makes for a better fighter, but with Orcs it seems like staying true to your ancestors is the path to victory.\nLet me start a few steps back. The Orc Strongholds have existed as long as the Orc race has, according to them. They're armored camps in the least, and fortresses at the most. Every man, woman, and child inside the walls  is trained from birth to defend it. All their weapons and armor are smithed right there in the stronghold, all the food is hunted down by Orc warriors and brought back to be eaten by everyone who lives there.\nThey follow no laws, save their own, an unwritten set of rules called \"The Code of Malacath,\" named after one of their gods, who is sometimes called Mauloch. Most of it's pretty simple, don't steal, don't kill, don't attack people for no reason (although there seems to be a big list of exceptions). But Orcs in the stronghold don't have jails for their criminals. They have Blood Price. You either pay enough in goods for your crimes, or you bleed enough that the victim is satisfied. And Orcs, I don't need to tell you, have a lot of blood.\nThe Code also sets up who runs the stronghold. The toughest male is usually the Chief and makes decisions and decides when the Code of Malacath has been satisfied. All the women are either the Chief's wives or his daughters, with the exception of the wise woman, who handles all the spiritual matters and healing needs. Matters of grave dispute are handled with short but violent fights, and those who don't get along with the Chief are usually forced out of the stronghold to live among the rest of us. An Orc grows up being told to fight for everything, that if something is not worth fighting for it is beneath the Code.\nOrc Strongholds don't like strangers, used to living on their own like they do. Ms. Alleia knows what she does because so many Orcs leave the strongholds to become sellswords or soldiers, and a few pints of mead gets them talking about home. I hear that sometimes an Orc will make a non-Orc a \"Blood-Kin\" and that person is then allowed to live in the stronghold as one of the clan, but I've never heard of that actually happening.\nFor all their strange rules and traditions, the Code of Malacath does breed a culture of determined warriors. They're focused in ways that the average sellsword isn't. They don't hesitate to draw weapons and settle matters openly, and I think that's the real difference between the stronghold Orcs and the city Orcs. Imperial Law allows you to settle fights through the Emperor's men, but the Code of Malacath demands you settle your problems yourself, a fine way of thinking if you're leading the mercenary's life."

    "text": "The last time I saw the old Argonian, I was taken by how alive he seemed, even though he was in the throes of death.\n\"The secret,\" he said, \"of staying alive... is not in running away, but swimming directly at danger. Catches it off-guard.\"\n\"Is that how you managed to find this claw?\" I asked, brandishing the small carving as if it were a weapon. I had found it among his possessions, which I was helping him to divvy amongst his beneficiaries. \"Should it also go to your cousin? Dives-From-Below?\"\nAt this, his mouth widened, exposing his fangs. If I hadn't known him as long as I had I would think he was snarling, but I knew that to be a smile. He croaked a few times to attempt laughter, but ended up wheezing and coughing, his rancid blood spraying across the bedsheets.\n\"Do you know what that is?\" he asked between coughing fits.\n\"I've heard stories,\" I answered, \"the same as you. Looks like one of the claws, for opening the sealing-doors in the ancient crypts. I've never seen one myself, before.\"\n\"Then you know I would only wish that thing upon a mortal enemy. Giving it to my cousin would just be encouraging him to run into one of those barrows and get split by a Draugr blade.\"\n\"So you want me to have it, then?\" I joked. \"Where did you even get this?\"\n\"My kind can find things that your people assumed were gone. Drop something to the bottom of a lake, and a Nord will never see it again. Amazing what you can find along the bottoms.\"\nHe was staring at the ceiling now, and but the way his fogged eyes darted around, I could tell he was seeing his memories instead of the cracked stone above us.\n\"Did you ever try to use it?\" I whispered to him, hoping he could hear me through his fog.\n\"Of course!\" he snapped, suddenly lucid. His eyes widened and fixed on me. \"Where do you think I got this?\" he barked, tearing his tunic open to show a white scar forming a large star-shaped knot in the scales beneath his right shoulder. \"Blasted Draugr got the drop on me. Just too many of them.\"\nI felt awful, since I knew how much he hated talking about the battles he had been in. To him, it was enough that he had survived, and any stories would amount to boasting. We both sat quietly for several minutes, his labored breathing the only sound.\nHe was the one to break the silence. \"You know what always bothered me?\" he asked. \"Why they even bothered with the symbols.\"\n\"The what?\"\n\"The symbols, you fool, look at the claw.\"\nI turned it over in my hand. Sure enough, etched into the face were three animals. A bear, an owl, and some kind of insect.\n\"What do the symbols mean, Deerkaza?\"\n\"The sealing-doors. It's not enough to just have the claw. They're made of massive stone wheels that must align with the claw's symbols before they'll open. It's a sort of lock, I suppose. But I didn't know why they bothered with them. If you had the claw, you also had the symbols to open the door. So why...\"\nHe was broken up by a coughing fit. It was the most I had heard him speak in months, but I could tell how much of a struggle it was. I knew his mind, though, and helped the thought along.\n\"Why even have a combination if you're going to write it on the key?\"\n\"Exactly. But as I lay bleeding on that floor, I figured it out. The Draugr are relentless, but far from clever. Once I was downed, they continued shuffling about. To no aim. No direction. Bumping against one another, the walls.\"\n\"So?\"\n\"So the symbols on the doors weren't meant to be another lock. Just a way of ensuring the person entering was actually alive and had a functioning mind.\"\n\"Then the doors...\"\n\"Were never meant to keep people out. They were meant to keep the Draugr in.\"\nAnd with that, he fell back asleep. When he awoke several days later, he refused to talk about the Draugr at all, and would only wince and clutch his shoulder if I tried to bring them up."

    "text": "The Dragon Break Reexamined\nby\nFal Droon\nThe late 3rd era was a period of remarkable religious ferment and creativity. The upheavals of the reign of Uriel VII were only the outward signs of the historical forces that would eventually lead to the fall of the Septim Dynasty. The so called \"Dragon Break\" was first proposed at this time, by a wide variety of cults and fringe sects across the Empire, connected only by a common obsession with the events surrounding Tiber Septim's rise to power -- the \"founding myth,\" if you will, of the Septim Dynasty.\nThe basis of the Dragon Break doctrine is now known to be a rather prosaic error in the timeline printed in the otherwise authoritative \"Encyclopedia Tamrielica,\" first published in 3E 12, during the early years of Tiber Septim's reign. At that time, the archives of Alinor were still inaccessible to human scholars, and the extant records from the Alessian period were extremely fragmentary. The Alessians had systematically burned all the libraries they could find, and their own records were largely destroyed during the War of Righteousness.\nThe author of the Encyclopedia Tamrielica was apparently unfamiliar with the Alessian \"year,\" which their priesthood used to record all dates. We now know this refers to the length of the long vision-trances undertaken by the High Priestess, which might last anywhere from a few weeks to several months. Based on analysis of the surviving trance scrolls, as well as murals and friezes from Alessian temples, I estimate that the Alessian Order actually lasted only about 150 years, rather than the famous \"one thousand and eight years\" given by the Encyclopedia Tamrielica. The \"mystery\" of the millennial-plus rule of the Alessians was accepted but unexplained until the spread of the Lorkhan cults in the late 3rd era, when the doctrine of the Dragon Break took hold. Because this dating (and explanation) was so widely held at the time, and then repeated by historians down through today, it has come to have the force of tradition. Recall, however, that the 3rd era historians were already separated from the Alessians by a gulf of more than 2,000 years. And history was still in its infancy, relying on the few archives from those early days.\nToday, modern archaeology and paleonumerology have confirmed what my own research in Alessian dating first suggested: that the Dragon Break was invented in the late 3rd era, based on a scholarly error, fueled by obsession with eschatology and Numidiumism, and perpetuated by scholarly inertia.\n"

    "text": "In the Merethic Era, when Ysgramor first set foot on Tamriel, his people brought with them a faith that worshipped animal gods. Certain scholars believe these primitive people actually worshipped the divines as we know them, just in the form of these totem animals. They deified the hawk, wolf, snake, moth, owl, whale, bear, fox, and the dragon. Every now and then you can stumble across the broken stone totems in the farther reaches of Skyrim.\nForemost among all animals was the dragon. In the ancient nordic tongue it was drah-gkon. Occasionally the term dov-rha is used, but the language or derivation of that is not known. Using either name was forbidden to all except the dragon priests. Grand temples were built to honor the dragons and appease them. Many of them survive today as ancient ruins haunted by draugr and undead dragon priests.\nDragons, being dragons, embraced their role as god-kings over men. After all, were they not fashioned in Akatosh's own image? Were they not superior in every way to the hordes of small, soft creatures that worshipped them? For dragons, power equals truth. They had the power, so therefore it must be truth. Dragons granted small amounts of power to the dragon priests in exchange for absolute obedience. In turn, the dragon priests ruled men as equals to the kings. Dragons, of course, could not be bothered with actually ruling.\nIn Atmora, where Ysgramor and his people came from, the dragon priests demanded tribute and set down laws and codes of living that kept peace between dragons and men. In Tamriel, they were not nearly as benevolent. It's unclear if this was due to an ambitious dragon priest, or a particular dragon, or a series of weak kings. Whatever the cause, the dragon priests began to rule with an iron fist, making virtual slaves of the rest of the population.\nWhen the populace rebelled, the dragon priests retaliated. When the dragon priests could not collect the tribute or control the masses, the dragons' response was swift and brutal. So it was the Dragon War began.\nAt first, men died by the thousands. The ancient texts reveal that a few dragons took the side of men. Why they did this is not known. The priests of the Nine Divines claim it was Akatosh himself that intervened. From these dragons men learned magics to use against dragons. The tide began to turn and dragons began to die too.\nThe war was long and bloody. The dragon priests were overthrown and dragons were slaughtered in large numbers. The surviving dragons scattered, choosing to live in remote places away from men. The dragon cult itself adapted and survived. They built the dragon mounds, entombing the remains of dragons that fell in the war. They believed that one day the dragons would rise again and reward the faithful."

To you Nords, we are the gray ones, the ashen-skinned, the \"dark elves\" of Morrowind who have as much place in your land as an infection in an open wound.\nOh yes, we have read your great cultural work, \"Nords of Skyrim,\" in which you extol the many virtues of your people and province, and invite any visitors to come experience your homeland for themselves. Well come we did, Nords, and the reception was less than was promised - but exactly what we expected.\nSo I, Atal Sarys, Dunmer and immigrant to Skyrim, have decided to answer your beloved book with a work of my own. And let all who read it know that Nords are not the only race to reside in this cold and inhospitable realm. For we dark elves have come, and little by little, shall claim Skyrim as our own.\nBut where, you may ask, have we taken up residence? Why none other than the ancient city of Windhelm, once the capital of the First Empire. Yes, Nords, in the shadow of your own Palace of the Kings, where the Nord hero Ysgramor once held court, we now thrive. Oh yes. Your beloved Five Hundred Companions may have driven our ancestors from Skyrim, but that was then. This is now.\nIndeed, one might be surprised as to just how well we've settled into Windhelm. The district once known as the Snow Quarter is thus named no more. Now, they call it the Gray Quarter, for such is the reality of the Dunmer occupation. The district is now populated entirely by my kind, a victory not lost on its residents.\nOh, but the peaceful occupation goes even further. Thirsty? You'll find no Nord mead hall in the Gray Quarter. But the spirits flow well enough in the New Gnisis Cornerclub. Seeking a respected family? You'll find no Gray-Manes within these walls. But perhaps you'd like to pay a visit to the home of Belyn Hlaalu, descendant of one of the most noble houses in all of Morrowind. Ah, but no. You Nords don't come to the Gray Quarter, do you? You fear our streets as you fear our skin.\nSo now, \"children of Skyrim,\" you have the truth of it. You may call this province home, but you can no sooner claim to own it than a cow can claim to own its master's field. You are just another breed of domestic animal, grazing stupidly while higher beings plot your slaughter."

    "text": "The Fall of Saarthal\n\nby\nHeseph Chirirnis, Mages Guild Scholar\nAssigned to Imperial Archaeologist Sentius Floronius\n\nLet it be known that the esteemed archaeologist has chosen to focus his boundless talents on the cooking and baking habits of early First Era Nords. While this work will no doubt bring great glory and benefit to the Empire, it is clear that my limited expertise is of no use to this effort.\nI have instead been using my considerable free time to investigate a particular avenue of study, namely that of the Fall of Saarthal. Every child of the Empire knows what happened here; that the first city of Man on Tamriel was sacked by the elves, jealous and fearful of the threat men posed to them. Relations have obviously improved considerably since then, but to be able to see the results of the destruction first-hand, it is quite striking to note the degree of effort that went into the venture.\nThe first task before me was differentiating between areas of original architecture and those that were rebuilt after Ysgramor retook the city with his five hundred companions. Initially relying heavily on the expertise of archaeologist Floronius, my ability to discern the difference for myself improved over time. Indeed, I was surprised to find that many areas of the city, far more than I would have believed, retained much of the original stonework. Work was clearly done to remedy the effects of the city being burned after the elves' assault, but I suspect they underestimated the durability of Nordic craftsmanship.\nOr rather, that is what I initially thought. Perhaps it was a mistaken sense of pride in the accomplishments of these early men, or perhaps it was just my inexperience that led me to this conclusion. Something was amiss, though. Repeated attempts to consult the exceedingly perceptive archaeologist were unfruitful, often digressing into lectures on the bathing habits of Saarthal residents, or the average number of potted plants in homes. I was again forced to rely on my limited powers of observation and deduction.\nAnd so I have no conclusive results to report at this time. I can say with certainty that the initial attack on Saarthal seems to have been very focused, and does not appear to correlate to any locations that have been established as points of defense or importance. While the eminent scholar Sentius has yet to examine my findings, or indeed show any interest in them, my inclination is to suggest that not only did the elves know the apparent layout of the city, but that their assault was based on a specific directive and perhaps a singular goal.\nMy humble investigations shall continue as time permits."

    "text": "I have studied, and traveled, and explored, and observed, and my hypothesis has finally been confirmed: that the twisted Falmer that inhabit the darkest depths of Skyrim are indeed the snow elves of legend.\nNo one really knows when the story of the snow elves began, but the ancient work \"Fall of the Snow Prince,\" which is an account of the Battle of the Moesring as transcribed by Lokheim, chronicler to the chieftain Ingjaldr White-Eye, gives a rather vivid account of its ending.\nAccording to this eyewitness account, the great Falmer leader known only as the Snow Prince died in glorious battle, and was buried with honor by his Nord slayers. The remaining snow elves were scattered or slain, and were never heard from again. Or so many thought.\nBut where the story of the ancient snow elves ends, that of the current-day Falmer begins. For when the snow elf host was shattered on that fateful day, it did not simply disperse - it descended. Into the earth, deep underground. For the Falmer sought sanctuary in the most unlikely of places - Blackreach, far beneath the surface of Skyrim, in the legendary realm of the Dwemer themselves.\nYes, Blackreach exists. I have been there, and unlike most of those who have witnessed its terrible glories, I have returned. And I now know the truth about the Falmer.\nAfter their defeat by the Nords, the dwarves of old agreed to protect the Falmer, but at a terrible price. For these Dwemer did not trust their snow elf guests, and forced them to consume the toxic fungi that once grew deep underground. As a result, the snow elves were rendered blind.\nSoon, the majestic snow elves were rendered powerless. They became the dwarves' servants... and then their slaves. But the Dwemer's treachery was so deep, so complete, that they made the fungi an essential part of the Falmer's diet. This guaranteed the weakness of not only their current Falmer thralls, but their offspring as well. The snow elves, for time eternal, would be blind.\nBut as is always the story with slaves and their masters, the Falmer eventually rebelled. Generations after they first sought solace among the dwarves, and experienced bitter betrayal, the Falmer rose up against their oppressors. The overthrew the dwarves, and fled even further down, into Blackreach's deepest, most hidden reaches.\nFor decade upon decade, the two sides waged a bitter conflict. A full-fledged and bloody \"War of the Crag\" that raged deep below Skyrim's surface, completely unbeknownst to the Nords above, a war whose battles and heroes must forever remain lost to our knowledge. Until one day, the war ended. For on that day, the Falmer went to meet their Dwemer foes in battle, only to find that the entire race had... vanished.\nFinally free from the threat of their Dwemer overlords, the Falmer were able to spread freely throughout Blackreach. But years of fighting the dwarves had left them bloodthirsty and brutal. Feeling the need to conquer, to kill, they began mounting raids to the surface world.\nAnd so the legends began. Of small, blind, goblin-like creatures who would rise from the cracks of the earth, in the dead of night, to slaughter cattle, attack lonely travelers, and steal sleeping babes from their cribs.\nIn recent years, however, the sightings of these creatures have become more and more frequent. Their raids, more organized. Their attacks, more brutal. In fact, one might even come to the conclusion that the Falmer are ready to change once again. Could it be true? Are the snow elves of ages past ready to reclaim their long-forgotten glory? Are they ready to surge to the surface, and make war upon the \"light dwellers\"?\nIf that happens - if the Falmer are indeed planning on reconquering Skyrim - I fear a horror neither man nor gods could possibly stand against."

But her brother Helseth lost and has fled with his mother back to Morrowind, and still Reman has not left her to marry me.\" Lady Gialene took a long, slow drag of the hookah and blew out dragon's breath, so the scent of blossoms perfumed her gilded chamber. \"You make a very poor advisor, Kael. I might have spent my time romancing the king of Cloudrest or Alinor instead of the wretched royal husband of Queen Morgiah.\"\nKael knew better than to hurt his lady's vanity by the mere suggestion that the King of Firsthold might have come to love his Dunmer Queen. Instead he gave her a few minutes to pause and look from her balcony out over the high cliff palaces of the ancient capitol. The moons shone like crystal on the deep sapphire waters of the Abecean Sea. It was ever springtide here, and he could well understand why she would prefer a throne in this land than in Cloudrest or Alinor.\nFinally, he spoke: \"The people are with you, my lady. They do not relish the idea of Reman's dark elf heirs ruling the kingdom when he is gone.\"\n\"I wonder,\" she said calmly. \"I wonder if as the King would not give up his Queen for want of alliances, whether she would give herself up out of fear. Of all the people of Firsthold, who most dislikes the Dunmer influence on the court?\"\n\"Is this a trick question, my lady?\" asked Kael. \"The Trebbite Monks, of course. Their credo has ever been for pure Altmer bloodlines on Summurset, and among the royal families most of all. But, my lady, they make very weak allies.\"\n\"I know,\" said Gialene, taking up her hookah again thoughtfully, a smile creeping across her face. \"Morgiah has seen to it that they have no power. She would have exterminated them altogether had Reman not stopped her for all the good they do for the country folk. What if they found themselves with a very powerful benefactress? One with intimate knowledge of the court of Firsthold, the chief concubine of the King, and all the gold to buy weapons with that her father, the King of Skywatch, could supply?\"\n\"Well-armed and with the support of the country people, they would be formidable,\" nodded Kael. \"But as your advisor, I must warn you: if you make yourself an active foe of Queen Morgiah, you must play to win. She has inherited much of her mother Queen Barenziah's intelligence and spirit of vengeance.\"\n\"She will not know I am her foe until it is too late,\" shrugged Gialene. \"Go to the Trebbite monastery and bring me Friar Lylim. We must strategize our plan of attack.\"\nFor two weeks, Reman was advised about growing resentment in the countryside from peasants who called Morgiah the \"Black Queen,\" but it was nothing that he had not heard before. His attention was on the pirates on a small island off the coast called Calluis Lar. They had been more brazen as late, attacking royal barges in organized raids. To deliver a crushing blow, he ordered the greatest part of his militia to invade the island -- an incursion he himself would lead.\nA few days after Reman left the capitol, the revolt of the Trebbite Monks exploded. The attacks were well-coordinated and without warning. The Chief of the Guards did not wait to be announced, bursting into Morgiah's bedchamber ahead of a flurry of maidservants.\n\"My Queen,\" he said. \"It is a revolution.\"\nBy contrast, Gialene was not asleep when Kael came to deliver the news. She was seated by the window, smoking her hookah and looking at the fires far off in the hills.\n\"Morgiah is with council,\" he explained. \"I am certain they are telling her that the Trebbite Monks are behind the uprising, and that the revolution will be at the city gates by morning.\"\n\"How large is the revolutionary army in contrast to the remaining royal militia?\" asked Gialene.\n\"The odds are well in our favor,\" said Kael. \"Though not perhaps as much as we hoped. The country folk, it seems, like to complain about their queen, but stop short of insurrection. Primarily, the army is composed of the Monks themselves and a horde of mercenaries your father's gold bought. In a way of thinking, it is preferable this way -- they are more professional and organized that a common mob. Really, they are a true army, complete with a horn section.\"\n\"If that doesn't frighten the Black Queen into abdication, nothing will,\" smiled Gialene, rising from her chair. \"The poor dear must be beside herself with worry. I must fly to her side and enjoy it.\"\nGialene was disappointed when she saw Morgiah come out of the Council Chambers. Considering that she had been woken from a deep sleep with cries of revolution and had spent the last several hours in consultation with her meager general force, she looked beautiful. There was a sparkle of proud defiance in her bright red eyes.\n\"My Queen,\" Gialene cried, forcing real tears. \"I came as soon as I heard! Will we all be slaughtered?\"\n\"A distinct possibility,\" replied Morgiah simply. Gialene tried to read her, but the expressions of women, especially alien women, were a far greater challenge than those of Altmer men.\n\"I hate myself for even thinking to propose this,\" said Gialene. \"But since the cause of their fury is you, perhaps if you were to give up the throne, they might disperse. Please understand, my queen, I am thinking only of the good of the kingdom and our own lives.\"\n\"I understand the spirit of your suggestion,\" smiled Morgiah. \"And I will take it under advisement. Believe me, I've thought of it myself. But I don't think it will come to that.\"\n\"Have you a plan for defending us?\" asked Gialene, contorting her features to an expression she knew bespoke girlish hope.\n\"The king left us several dozen of his royal battlemages,\" said Morgiah. \"I think the mob believes we have nothing but palace guards and a few soldiers to protect us. When they get to the gates are greeted with a wave of fireballs, I find it highly likely that they will lose heart and retreat.\"\n\"But isn't there some protection they could be using against such an assault?\" asked Gialene in her best worried voice.\n\"If they knew about it, naturally there is. But an unruly mob is unlikely to have mages skilled in the arts of Restoration, by which they could shield themselves from the spells, or Mysticism, by which they could reflect the spells back on my battlemages. That would be the worst scenario, but even if they were well-organized enough to have Mystics in their ranks -- and enough of them to reflect so many spells -- it just isn't done. No battlefield commander would advise such a defense during a siege unless he knew precisely what he was going to be meeting. And then, of course, once the trap is sprung\" Morgiah winked. \"It's too late for a countering spell.\"\n\"A most cunning solution, your highness,\" said Gialene, honestly impressed.\nMorgiah excused herself to meet with her battlemages, and Gialene gave her an embrace. Kael was waiting in the palace garden for his lady.\n\"Are there Mystics among the mercenaries?\" she asked quickly.\n\"Several, in fact,\" replied Kael, bewildered by her query. \"Largely rejects from the Psijic Order, but they know enough to cast the regular spells of the school.\"\n\"You must sneak out the city gates and tell Friar Lylim to have them cast reflection spells on all the front line before they attack,\" said Gialene.\n\"That's most irregular battlefield strategy,\" frowned Kael.\n\"I know it is, fool, that's what Morgiah is counting on. There's a gang of battlemages who are going to be waiting on the battlements to greet our army with a barrage of fire balls.\"\n\"Battlemages? I would have thought that King Reman would have brought them with him to fight the pirates.\"\n\"You would have thought that,\" laughed Gialene. \"But then we would be defeated. Now go!\"\nFriar Lylim agreed with Kael that it was a bizarre, unheard-of way to begin a battle, casting reflection spells on all one's troops. It went against every tradition, and as a Trebbite Monk, he valued tradition above every other virtue. There was little other choice, though, given the intelligence. He had few enough healers in the army as it were, and their energies could not be wasted casting resistance spells.\nAt dawn's light, the rebel army was in sight of the gleaming spires of Firsthold. Friar Lylim gathered together every soldier who knew even the rudimentary secrets of Mysticism, who knew how to tap in to the elementary conundrums and knots of the energies of magicka. Though few were masters of the art, their combined force was powerful to behold. A great surge of entangling power washed over the army, crackling, hissing, and infusing all with their ghostly force. When they arrived at the gates, every soldier, even the least imaginative, knew that no spell would touch him for a long time.\nFriar Lylim watched his army batter into the gate with the great satisfaction of a commander who has counteracted an unthinkable attack with an outrageous defense. The smile quickly faded from his face.\nThey were met at the battlements not by mages but by common archers of the palace guard. As the flaming arrows fell upon the siegers like a red rain, the healers ran in to help the wounded. Their healing spells reflected off the dying men, one after the other. Chaos ruled as the attackers suddenly found themselves defenseless and began a panicked, unorganized retreat. Friar Lylim himself considered briefly holding his ground before fleeing himself.\nLater, he would send furious notes to Lady Gialene and Kael, but they were returned. Even his best secret agents within the palace were unable to find their whereabouts.\nNeither had, as it turns out, much previous experience with torture, and they soon confessed their treachery to the King's satisfaction. Kael was executed, and Gialene was sent back with escort to her father's court of Skywatch. He has still to find a husband for her. Reman, by contrast, has elected not to take a new royal concubine. The common folk of Firsthold consider this break in palace protocol to be more of the sinister alien influence of the Black Queen, and grumble to all who will listen.\n"

    "text": "\nA Concise Account of\nthe Great War Between\nthe Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion\n\nby\nLegate Justianus Quintius\nAuthor's Note: Much of what is written in this book is pieced together from documents captured from the enemy during the war, interrogation of prisoners, and eyewitness accounts from surviving soldiers and Imperial officers. I myself commanded the Tenth Legion in Hammerfell and Cyrodiil until I was wounded in 175 during the assault on the Imperial City. That said, the full truth of some events may never be known. I have done my best to fill in the gaps with educated conjectures based on my experience as well as my hard-earned knowledge of the enemy.\nThe Rise of the Thalmor\nAlthough it is not well known, Summerset Isle suffered from the Oblivion Crisis as much as Cyrodiil did. The elves made war upon the Oblivion invaders, occasionally even crossing over to close down Oblivion gates. As a nation they had more successes than Cyrodiil did, although the limitless daedric hordes made the outcome a foregone conclusion.\nThe Thalmor had always been a powerful faction within Summerset Isle, but had also always been a minority voice. During the crisis, the Crystal Tower was forced to give the Thalmor greater power and authority. Their efforts almost certainly saved Summerset Isle from being overrun. They capitalized on their success to seize total control in 4E 22. They renamed the nation Alinor, which hearkens back to an earlier age before the ascendency of man. Most people outside of the Aldmeri Dominion still call it Summerset Isle, either out of peevishness or ignorance.\nIn 4E 29, the government of Valenwood was overthrown by Thalmor collaborators and a union with Alinor proclaimed. It appears that Thalmor agents had formed close ties to certain Bosmeri factions even before the Oblivion Crisis. The Empire and its Bosmer allies, caught completely off guard, were quickly defeated by the much-better prepared Altmer forces that invaded Valenwood on the heels of the coup. Thus was the Aldmeri Dominion reborn.\nShortly afterward the Aldmeri Dominion severed all contact with the Empire. For seventy years they were silent. Most scholars believe there was some sort of internal strife in Alinor, but very little is known of the factional struggles that went on inside the Dominion while the Thalmor consolidated its power in Summerset and Valenwood.\nIn 4E 98, the two moons, Masser and Secunda vanished. Within most of the Empire, this was viewed with trepidation and fear. In Elsweyr it was far worse. Culturally the moons are much more influential to the Khajiit. After two years of the Void Nights, the moons returned. The Thalmor announced that they had restored the moons using previously unknown Dawn Magicks, but it is unclear if they truly restored the moons or just took advantage of foreknowledge that they would return.\nRegardless of the truth of the matter, the Khajiit credited the Thalmor as their saviors. Within fifteen years, Imperial influence in Elsweyr had so diminished that the Empire was unable to respond effectively to the coup of 4E 115 which dissolved the Elsweyr Confederacy and recreated the ancient kingdoms of Anequina and Pelletine as client states of the Aldmeri Dominion. Once more the Empire failed to stop the advance of Thamor power.\nWhen Titus Mede II ascended the throne in 4E 168, he inherited a weakened empire. The glory days of the Septims were a distant memory. Valenwood and Elsweyr were gone, ceded to the Thalmor enemy. Black Marsh had been lost to Imperial rule since the aftermath of the Oblivion Crisis. Morrowind had never recovered fully from the eruption of Mount Vvardenfell. Hammerfell was plagued by infighting between Crowns and Forebears. Only High Rock, Cyrodiil and Skyrim remained prosperous and peaceful.\nEmperor Titus Mede had only a few short years to consolidate his rule before his leadership was put to the ultimate test.\nThe War Begins\nOn the 30th of Frostfall, 4E 171, the Aldmeri Dominion sent an ambassador to the Imperial City with a gift in a covered cart and an ultimatum for the new Emperor. The long list of demands included staggering tributes, disbandment of the Blades, outlawing the worship of Talos, and ceding large sections of Hammerfell to the Dominion. Despite the warnings of his generals of the Empire's military weakness, Emperor Titus Mede II rejected the ultimatum. The Thalmor ambassador upended the cart, spilling over a hundred heads on the floor: every Blades agent in Summerset and Valenwood. And so began the Great War which would consume the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion for the next five years.\nWithin days, Aldmeri armies invaded Hammerfell and Cyrodiil simultaneously. A strong force commanded by the Thalmor general Lord Naarifin attacked Cyrodiil from the south, marching out of hidden camps in northern Elsweyr and flanking the Imperial defenses along the Valenwood border. Leyawiin soon fell to the invaders, while Bravil was cut off and besieged.\nAt the same time, an Aldmeri army under Lady Arannelya crossed into western Cyrodiil from Valenwood, bypassing Anvil and Kvatch and crossing into Hammerfell. Smaller Aldmeri forces landed along the southern coastline of Hammerfell. The disunited Redguard forces offered only scattered resistance to the invaders, and much of the southern coastline was quickly overrun. The greatly outnumbered Imperial legions retreated across the Alik'r Desert in the now-famous March of Thirst.\n4E 172-173: The Aldmeri Advance Into Cyrodiil\nIt appears now that the initial Aldmeri objective was in fact the conquest of Hammerfell, and that the invasion of Cyrodiil was intended only to pin down the Imperial legions while Hammerfell was overrun. However, the surprising initial success of Lord Naarifin's attack led the Thalmor to believe that the Empire was weaker than they had thought. The capture of the Imperial City itself and the complete overthrow of the Empire thus became their primary objective of the next two years. As we know, the Thalmor nearly achieved their objective. It was only because of our Emperor's determined leadership during the Empire's darkest hour that this disaster was averted.\nDuring 4E 172, the Aldmeri advanced deeper into Cyrodiil. Bravil and Anvil both fell to the invaders. By the end of the year, Lord Naarifin had advanced to the very walls of the Imperial City. There were fierce naval clashes in Lake Rumare and along the Niben as the Imperial forces attempted to hold the eastern bank.\nIn Hammerfell, the Thalmor were content to consolidate their gains as they took control of the whole southern coastline, which was in fact their stated objective in the ultimatum delivered to the Emperor. Of the southern cities, only Hegathe still held out. The survivors of the March of Thirst regrouped in northern Hammerfell, joined by reinforcements from High Rock.\nThe year 4E 173 saw stiffening Imperial resistance in Cyrodiil, but the seemingly inexorable Aldmeri advance continued. Fresh legions from Skyrim bolstered the Emperor's main army in the Imperial City, but the Aldmeri forced the crossing of the Niben and began advancing in force up the eastern bank. By the end of the year, the Imperial City was surrounded on three sides - only the northern supply route to Bruma remained open.\nIn Hammerfell, Imperial fortunes took a turn for the better. In early 4E 173, a Forebear army from Sentinel broke the siege of Hegathe (a Crown city), leading to the reconciliation of the two factions. Despite this, Lady Arannelya's main army succeeded in crossing the Alik'r Desert. The Imperial Legions under General Decianus met them outside Skaven in a bloody and indecisive clash. Decianus withdrew and left Arannelya in possession of Skaven, but the Aldmeri were too weakened to continue their advance.\n4E 174: The Sack of the Imperial City\nIn 4E 174, the Thalmor leadership committed all available forces to the campaign in Cyrodiil, gambling on a decisive victory to end the war once and for all. During the spring, Aldmeri reinforcements gathered in southern Cyrodiil, and on 12th of Second Seed, they launched a massive assault on the Imperial City itself. One army drove north to completely surround the city, while Lord Naarifin's main force attacked the walls from the south, east, and west. The Emperor's decision to fight his way out of the city rather than make a last stand was a bold one. No general dared advise him to abandon the capital, but Titus II was proven right in the end.\nWhile the Eighth Legion fought a desperate (and doomed) rearguard action on the walls of the city, Titus II broke out of the city to the north with his main army, smashing through the surrounding the Aldmeri forces and linking up with reinforcements marching south from Skyrim under General Jonna. Meanwhile, however, the capital fell to the invaders and the infamous Sack of the Imperial City began. The Imperial Palace was burned, the White-Gold Tower itself looted, and all manner of atrocities carried out by the vengeful elves on the innocent populace.\nIn Hammerfell, General Decianus was preparing to drive the Aldmeri back from Skaven when he was ordered to march for Cyrodiil. Unwilling to abandon Hammerfell completely, he allowed a great number of \"invalids\" to be discharged from the Legions before they marched east. These veterans formed the core of the army that eventually drove Lady Arannelya's forces back across the Alik'r late in 174, taking heavy losses on their retreat from harassing attacks by the Alik'r warriors.\n4E 175: The Battle of the Red Ring\nDuring the winter of 4E 174-175, the Thalmor seem to have believed that the war in Cyrodiil was all but over. They made several attempts to negotiate with Titus II. The Emperor encouraged them in their belief that he was preparing to surrender; meanwhile, he gathered his forces to retake the Imperial City.\nIn what is now known as the Battle of the Red Ring, a battle that will serve as a model for Imperial strategists for generations to come, Titus II divided his forces into three. One army, with the legions from Hammerfell under General Decianus, was hidden in the Colovian Highlands near Chorrol. The Aldmeri were unaware that he was no longer in Hammerfell, possibly because the Imperial veterans Decianus had left behind led Lady Arannelya to believe that she still faced an Imperial army. The second army, largely of Nord legions under General Jonna, took up position near Cheydinhal. The main army was commanded by the Emperor himself, and would undertake the main assault of the Imperial City from the north.\nOn the 30th of Rain's Hand, the bloody Battle of the Red Ring began as General Decianus swept down on the city from the west, while General Jonna's legionnaires drove south along the Red Ring Road. In a two-day assault, Jonna's army crossed the Niben and advanced west, attempting to link up with Decianus's legions and thus surround the Imperial City. Lord Naarifin was taken by surprise by Decianus's assault, but Jonna's troops faced bitter resistance as the Aldmeri counterattacked from Bravil and Skingrad. The heroic Nord legionnaires held firm, however, beating off the piecemeal Aldmeri attacks. By the fifth day of the battle, the Aldmeri army in the Imperial City was surrounded.\nTitus II led the assault from the north, personally capturing Lord Naarifin. It is rumored the Emperor wielded the famed sword Goldbrand, although this has never been officially confirmed by the Imperial government. An attempt by the Aldmeri to break out of the city to the south was blocked by the unbreakable shieldwall of General Jonna's battered legions.\nIn the end, the main Aldmeri army in Cyrodiil was completely destroyed. The Emperor's decision to withdraw from the Imperial City in 4E 174 was bloodily vindicated.\nLord Naarifin was kept alive for thirty-three days, hanging from the White-Gold tower. It is not recorded where his body was buried, if it was buried at all. Once source claims he was carried off by a winged daedra on the thirty-fourth day.\nThe White-Gold Concordat and the End of the War\nAlthough victorious, the Imperial armies were in no shape to continue the war. The entire remaining Imperial force was gathered in Cyrodiil, exhausted and decimated by the Battle of the Red Ring. Not a single legion had more than half its soldiers fit for duty. Two legions had been effectively annihilated, not counting the loss of the Eighth during the retreat from the Imperial City the previous year. Titus II knew that there would be no better time to negotiate peace, and late in 4E 175 the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion signed the White-Gold Concordat, ending the Great War.\nThe terms were harsh, but Titus II believed that it was necessary to secure peace and give the Empire a chance to regain its strength. The two most controversial terms of the Concordat were the banning of the worship of Talos and the cession of a large section of southern Hammerfell (most of what was already occupied by Aldmeri forces). Critics have pointed out that the Concordat is almost identical to the ultimatum the Emperor rejected five years earlier. However, there is a great difference between agreeing to such terms under the mere threat of war, and agreeing to them at the end of a long and destructive war. No part of the Empire would have accepted these terms in 4E 171, dictated by the Thalmor at swords-point. Titus II would have faced civil war. By 4E 175, most of the Empire welcomed peace at almost any price.\nEpilogue: Hammerfell Fights On Alone\nHammerfell, however, refused to accept the White-Gold Concordat, being unwilling to concede defeat and the loss of so much of their territory. Titus II was forced to officially renounce Hammerfell as an Imperial province in order to preserve the hard-won peace treaty. The Redguards, understandably, looked on this as a betrayal. In this, the Thalmor certainly achieved one of their long-term goals by sowing lasting bitterness between Hammerfell and the Empire.\nIn the end, the heroic Redguards fought the Aldmeri Dominion to a standstill, although the war lasted for five more years and left southern Hammerfell devastated. The Redguards say that this proves that the White-Gold Concordat was unnecessary, and that if Titus II had kept his nerve, the Aldmeri could have been truly defeated by the combined forces of Hammerfell and the rest of the Empire. The truth of that assertion can, of course, never be known. But the Redguards should not forget the great sacrifice of Imperial blood - Breton, Nord, and Cyrodilic - at the Battle of the Red Ring that weakened the Dominion enough to allow the eventual Second Treaty of Stros M'kai in 4E 180 and the withdrawal of Aldmeri forces from Hammerfell.\nThere can be no doubt that the current peace cannot last forever. The Thalmor take the long view, as is proved by the sequence of events leading up to the Great War. All those who value freedom over tyranny can only hope that before it is too late, Hammerfell and the Empire will be reconciled and stand united against the Thalmor threat. Otherwise, any hope to stem the tide of Thalmor rule over all of Tamriel is dimmed.\n"

    "text": "The Guardian and the Traitor\nby\n\tLucius Gallus\n\tFellow of the Imperial Library\n\tYear 376 of the Third Era\nOne of the more intriguing legends found on the island of Solstheim is the story of a mythical figure whose name is long forgotten, but whom time remembers as \"the Traitor.\"\nCertain that this myth is rooted in history I set out to learn what I could and perhaps piece together a presumptive account of the events that gave rise to the legend.\nThe tale is remembered best by the shamans of the Skaal, that unique tribe of Nords whose culture evolved along an entirely divergent path than that of their brethren in Skyrim.\nI spoke at length to the shaman of Skaal Village, a wise and hospitable man named Breigr Winter-Moon. He described an age long ago when dragons ruled over the whole world and were worshipped as gods by men. Presiding over this cult of dragon-worshippers were the Dragon Priests, powerful mages who could speak the dragon language and call upon the power of the thu'um, or Voice.\nAccording to the legend, one such Dragon Priest was seduced by a dark spirit named Herma-Mora, an unmistakable analogue for the Daedric prince Hermaeus Mora. Lured by promises of power, this treacherous priest secretly plotted against his dragon master.\nThe Traitor's plot was discovered by one of his contemporaries, another Dragon Priest whom legend named The Guardian. The two fought a mighty battle that lasted for days, each hurling terrible arcane energies and thu'um shouts at the other.\nSo great and terrible were the forces unleashed in this contest that Solstheim was torn apart from the mainland of Skyrim. Here, the myth clearly descends into the realm of pure fantasy.\nThe Guardian, whom the legend presents as a paragon of loyalty and nobility, finally defeats the despicable Traitor, who seems to represent all that is corrupt and evil in men. Their epic duel is clearly representative of a greater struggle between good and evil. Perhaps it is this timeless quality that has kept the tale alive for so long.\nUnlike many similar myths, the tale of the Guardian and the Traitor does not feature a suitably heroic ending. Herma-Mora snatches the Traitor away just as the Guardian is about to strike the killing blow.\nThe dragons appoint the Guardian ruler of Solstheim, but not before he is compelled to swear an oath of vigilance to watch for the Traitor's return. His reign is, by all accounts, a time of peace and prosperity for the people of the island, and he is remembered as a wise and just leader.\nNo further mention is made of the Traitor, but neither is he thought to be dead. The legend ends on a cautionary note that the people of Solstheim, the heirs of the Guardian, must remain wary, lest the dark influence of Herma-Mora, or even the Traitor himself, return someday.\nAlthough no physical clues exist now on Solstheim to suggest the presence of the dragon cult, is it hardly difficult to believe that it might once have flourished here. Perhaps some hidden tomb still waits to be discovered that will tell the truth of the tale.\nThere are other tantalizing clues, though perhaps these connections strain the bonds of credibility. For example, is it possible that the Skaal deity, the All-Maker, is some distant echo of mighty Alduin, the World-Eater of the ancient Nord pantheon?\nPerhaps not, but one thing is certain: Solstheim's history is riddled with unanswered questions. Perhaps future generations will pull aside the veils of mystery and reveal the truth about the origins of the Skaal and the identities of the Guardian and the Traitor."

    "description": "Descriptions of the Holds, their capitals, and their strategic values in the war.",
    "text": "The Holds of Skyrim:\nA Field Officer's Guide\nFor Use by Officers of the Imperial Legion\n\nWelcome, loyal officer of the Empire. You have been given this guide to help you, and those men under your command, better understand the geography of Skyrim. Since you will be serving in Skyrim for a lengthy period of time, this information should prove invaluable.\nSkyrim is organized into nine holds. A hold is a large area of land roughly equivalent to a county in Cyrodiil. Each hold is governed by a Jarl who maintains his court in the hold's capital city.\nFour of these holds are fairly small and sparsely populated. As a result, the capitals are little more than towns. The five major cities of Skyrim act as capitals for the larger holds.\nFollowing is a detailed review of each hold.\nEASTMARCH\nLocated in the eastern reaches of Skyrim, Eastmarch shares a common border with Morrowind. Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak rules from the ancient city of Windhelm, and he and his followers should be considered your most serious threat.\nDo not tread lightly in Eastmarch, for the Stormcloaks are at their strongest and most organized in these lands. As an Imperial soldier, you will find few friends here.\nHAAFINGAR\nSolitude, the seat of High King of Skyrim and the capital of Haafingar hold, has always welcomed the Empire with open arms. Much commerce flows along the rivers here, and you will find the folk of this hold to be among the most hospitable in Skyrim.\nAs you venture forth in your campaigns, be sure to maintain a secure supply line back to Solitude. The Empire maintains ample provisions in Castle Dour, from which General Tullius commands all the legions stationed in Skyrim.\nHJAALMARCH\nThis hold is divided evenly between wind-swept tundra dotted with farms and a huge, stinking salt marsh. There is little of interest here, save perhaps for the hold's capital, Morthal.\nJarl Idgrod Ravencrone has been cooperative enough with the Empire in the past, but will ultimately look out for her own iterests if put in a difficult position.\nWhile the hold offers minimal strategic value to the Empire, it would make an ideal staging ground for a Stormcloak siege of Solitude, and so must be held against the enemy.\nTHE PALE\nThe Pale is a barren realm covered by vast fields of ice and snow. Its boundaries stretch from the center of Skyrim all the way to its northern coast. Here, at the capital city of Dawnstar, can be found one of the busiest ports in the province.\nWith access to the coastal waterways of Skyrim, Dawnstar could prove vital in the war effort. Should the Stormcloaks choose to attack Solitude from the river, this port would make a tempting target due to its close proximity.\nTHE REACH\nDominating the western border of Skyrim, the Reach is made up almost entirely of steep, craggy mountains. Little grows in this forbidding realm, but the capital city of Markarth is a nigh-impregnable stone fortress that would make an excellent defensive position for either side in the war.\nBe aware that this dangerous region of Skyrim is home to the Forsworn, the rebellious natives of the Reach. They know the terrain, can strike without warning, and count the Empire as an enemy. If they attack, you must neither give nor expect any mercy.\nTHE RIFT\nThis hold occupies the southeast corner of Skyrim, and much like the Reach in the west, is dominated by tall mountain peaks. The climate in the Reach is milder than in the northern holds, and there is more vegetation to be found here. Farming thrives as a result.\nA word of warning about Riften, the hold's capital city. Our agents have reason to suspect that the Thieves' Guild makes it home here, though it is now much diminished from its strength of previous years.\nNevertheless, mind that your men keep an eye on their coin purses should they have reason to spend any length of time in the city.\nWHITERUN\nThis central hold is characterized by wide, grassy plains that are home to numerous farms. Many roads pass through Whiterun, joining the more distant holds together.\nThe hold's capital city, also called Whiterun, sits high on a rocky promontory amid a large, flat swath of scrubland. Among the wealthiest cities of Skyrim, Whiterun has usually proven friendly to the Emperor's soldiers.\nWINTERHOLD\nThis bleak, snow-blown hold in the northeast corner of Skyrim is utterly inhospitable. Perhaps the mages at the College of Winterhold chose to make their home there because they knew they would be left largely alone.\nAs with Whiterun, the name Winterhold describes both the hold and its capital city, though the word \"city\" hardly applies. The hold capital is a meager village built near the mages' college.\nFew other noteworthy settlements exist in this frozen waste, and it is unlikely to play any significant part in the war.\n"

    "description": "A tale of a child blessed by a prophesy and the interpretaion thereof.",
    "text": "One of the few magical arts the Psijics of Artaeum have kept to themselves, away from the common spells and schools of the Mages Guild, is the gift of divination.  Despite this, or perhaps because of it, omens and prophesies abound in Tamriel, some of substance, others of pure folly, and still others so ambiguous as to be unverifiable.  There are still other prophesies kept secret, from the prophesies of Dro'Jizad in Elsweyr and the Nerevarine in Morrowind, to the Elder Scrolls themselves.\nThe Nord nobility have a tradition of having omens read for their children.  In general, these readings are of the obscure variety.  One of my acquaintances told me that her parents were told, for example, that their daughter would have her life rescued by a snake, and so gave her the name Serpentkin in a special ceremony.  And this young lady, Eria Valkor Serpentkin, was indeed saved by a snake many years later, when an assassin creeping on her stepped on a danswyrm viper.\nOccasionally, omens seem to be almost purposefully misleading, as if Boethiah had crafted them as traps.  I recall one particularly.  Many, many years ago, a male child was born into House Redoran.  It was a very difficult birth, and the mother was delirious and near death by the time it was over.  She chanted just as her son came into the world and she passed from it.\nFortune has smiled this day not frowned\nMy child will be mighty in mind and in arm\nHe shall bring hope to House Redoran\nNeither spell nor blade shall hurt the man\nNor illness nor poison cause any harm\nHis blood shall never drop on the ground\nThe boy, named Andas, was indeed extraordinary.  He never was ill and never suffered so much as a scratch all through his childhood.  He was also quite intelligent and strong, which, combined with his invulnerability, caused many to call him, after his mother's omen, the Hope of the Redoran.  Of course, any one who is called the Hope of the Redoran will eventually develop some taint of impertinence, and it wasn't long before he had enemies.\nHis worst enemy was his cousin Athyn, who had borne much abuse at the hands of Andas.  Primary among the grudges was that Athyn had been sent to Rihad to complete his education at Andas's insistence.  When Athyn returned from Hammerfell, it was because of the death of his father, who had also been a councilor of the House.  Athyn was old enough to take his seat in the Council, but Andas claimed the seat as well, saying that his cousin had been gone too long from Morrowind and didn't understand politics as he did.  The majority of the House agreed with Andas, wanting to see the Hope of Redoran rise quickly.\nAthyn exercised his right to combat his cousin for the seat.  No one thought he had any chance of winning, of course, but the battle was scheduled to commence the following morn.  Andas whored and dined and drank with the councilors that night, confident that his place in the House was secured and the hopeful new dawn of House Redoran was rising.  Athyn retired to his castle with his friends, Andas's enemies, and his servants he had brought from Hammerfell.\nAthyn and his friends were discussing the duel morosely when one of his old teachers, a warrior called Shardie, came into the hall.  She had grown quite proud of her student over the years in Hammerfell, proud enough to accompany him across the Empire to his family's lands, and wanted to know why they had so little confidence in his odds in the battle.  They explained to her Andas's uncommon blessings and the nature of his mother's omen.\n\"If he can't be harmed by disease, poison, magicka, and his blood can never be spilled, what hope have I of ever besting him?\" cried Athyn.\n\"Have you remembered nothing I taught you?\" replied Shardie. \"Is there no weapon you can think of that will slay without blood?  Are swords and spears and arrows the only items in your arsenal?\"\nAthyn quickly realized the weapon Shardie was speaking of, but it seemed absurd.  Not only absurd, but pathetic and primitive.  Still, it was the only hope he had.  All that night, Shardie trained him in the art and techniques, showing him the various swings and stances her people had developed in Albion-Gora; counter-attacks, feints, and blocks imported from Yokuda; the classic one and two-handed grips for the most ancient weapon in history.\nThe cousins faced one another the next morning, and never have two combatants looked so unevenly matched.  Andas's entrance brought a great cheer, for not only was he much beloved as the Hope of the Redoran, but as his victory was a foregone conclusion, most wanted to be in good standing with him.  His shining mail and blade drew admiration and awe.  By contrast, Athyn drew a gasp of surprise and only a smattering of polite applause.  He appeared costumed and armed like a barbarian.\nAs Shardie had suggested, Athyn allowed Andas to attack first.  The Hope of the Redoran was eager to finish the battle and take the power he deserved quickly.  The blade pushed by Andas's mighty arm slashed across Athyn's chest, but shallowly, and before it could be counterswung, Athyn knocked it back with his own weapon.  When Athyn attacked and wounded Andas, the Hope of the Redoran was so surprised by being hurt for the first time in his life, he dropped his sword.\nThe less said about the end of the battle, the better.  Suffice it to say that Athyn, wielding a simple club, battered Andas to death without spilling a drop of blood.\nAthyn took his father's seat as councilor, and it was then said that the hope in the omen referred to Athyn, not Andas.  After all, had Andas not tried to take the councilor seat away from his cousin, Athyn, being not very ambitious, might have never tried to get it.  It can certainly be argued that way, I suppose."

    "text": "Among the ancient ancestral spirits who accompanied Saint Veloth and the Chimer into the promised land of Morrowind, the four Daedra Lords, Malacath, Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, and Sheogorath, are known as the Four Corners of the House of Troubles. These Daedra Lords rebelled against the counsel and admonition of the Tribunal, causing great kinstrife and confusion among the clans and Great Houses.\nMalacath, Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, and Sheogorath are holy in that they serve the role of obstacles during the Testing. Through time they have sometimes become associated with local enemies, like the Nords, Akaviri, or Mountain Orcs.\nMalacath is the reanimated dung that was Trinimac, Malacath is a weak but vengeful god. The Dark Elves say he is Malak, the god-king of the orcs. He tests the Dunmer for physical weakness.\nMolag Bal is, in Morrowind, the King of Rape. He tries to upset the bloodlines of Houses and otherwise ruin the Dunmer gene pool. A race of monsters, said to live in Molag Amur, are the result of his seduction of Vivec during the previous era.\nSheogorath is the King of Madness. He always tests the Dunmer for mental weakness. In many legends he is called upon by one Dunmer faction against another; in half of these stories he does not betray those who called him, further confusing the issue of his place in the scheme of things (can he help us? is he not an obstacle?). He is often associated with the fear other races have of the Dunmer, especially those who, like the Empire, might prove as useful allies.\nMehrunes Dagon is the god of destruction. He is associated with natural dangers like fire, earthquakes, and floods. To some he represents the inhospitable land of Morrowind. He tests the Dunmer will to survive and persevere.\nThe worship of these four malevolent spirits is against the law and practice of the Temple. However, the Four Corners seldom fail to discover those greedy, reckless, or mad enough to serve them. By ancient Temple law and custom, and also by imperial law, the lives of witches and warlocks are forfeit, and Imperial garrisons join Ordinators and Buoyant Armigers of the Temple in tracking down and destroying these foul covens in the wilderness refuges and ancient ruins where they conceal their profane worships."

    "description": "A history of the fall of the Ayleid empire.",
    "text": "The Ayleids, or Heartland High Elves, ruled Cyrodiil in the long ages of Myth before the beginning of recorded history. One of the earliest recorded dates, in fact, is the Fall of White Gold Tower in 1E 243, which is commonly assumed to mark the end of the Ayleids.\nAlthough Ayleid rule over all of Cyrodiil was indeed broken in 1E 243, this was only one of the most obvious stages near the end of a long decline. The first two centuries of the First Era saw increasing strife between the great Ayleid lords of Cyrodiil. Alessia appears to have taken advantage of a period of civil war to launch her uprising. Imperial historians have traditionally attributed her victory to intervention from Skyrim, but it appears that she had at least as much help from rebel Ayleid lords during the siege of White Gold Tower.\nThe popular image of the Ayleids as brutal slavemasters is based in fact, of course, but it is less well-known that a number of Ayleid princes continued to rule parts of Cyrodiil after 263, as vassals of the new Empress of Cyrodiil. This suggests either that Ayleid rule was not universally detested, or that Alessia and her successors were more pragmatic than is traditionally believed, or perhaps some of both.\nIn any event, excavations at a number of Ayleid sites show continued occupation and even expansion during the so-called Late Ayleid Period (1E 243 - c. 498). At first, many Ayleid lords continued to rule as vassals of the new human regime. In some cases, Ayleid supporters of Alessia were even rewarded with new lands taken from slain enemies. It is not clear to what extent human slavery continued under the Cyrodilic Empire. Humans continued to dwell in the Ayleid-ruled areas of Cyrodiil, but there is nothing definitive to show under what terms.\nThis was an uneasy relationship from the beginning, and was not destined to last long. Resentment at the continued presence of Ayleid nobles within the Empire was a contributing factor to the rise of the so-called Alessian Order founded by Maruhk. The first victims of the Alessians were the Ayleids of Cyrodiil. In the early 300s, the surviving Ayleid communities in human-ruled areas were obliterated one by one, the refugees temporarily swelling the power of the remaining Ayleid lordships.\nThen in 361, the Alessians gained control of the Empire and enforced the Alessian Doctrines throughout its domain. The Ayleid lordships were abolished. Enforcement of this decree does not appear to have required much direct violence -- it seems that by this point the balance of power was so overwhelmingly against them, and their fate so long foreshadowed, that most of the remaining Ayleids simply left Cyrodiil, eventually being absorbed into the Elven populations of Valenwood and High Rock. Indeed, the rise of the Direnni Hegemony may be linked to this exodus of Ayleids from Cyrodiil (a connection so far little studied by historians).\nStill, a remnant Ayleid population seems to have survived the rule of the Alessians, because we hear of \"the last king of the Ayleids\" joining the battle of Glenumbria Moors where the Dirennis decisively defeated the Alessians in 482. How this king's people survived the preceding century is unknown. We do not even know who they were, although recent research points to Nenalata as the possible resting place of this \"last king.\" Unfortunately, in the current state of the Empire, funds are no longer available for proper scientific investigation of such extensive ruins, so the answer to these questions will have to be left to future generations.\n"

    "volume": "1",
    "chapter": "History",
    "description": "A short biography of the mad Pelagius III.",
    "text": "The man who would be Emperor of all Tamriel was born Thoriz Pelagius Septim, a prince of the royal family of Wayrest in 3E 119 at the end of the glorious reign of his uncle, Antiochus I. Wayrest had been showered by much preference during the years before Pelagius' birth, for King Magnus was Antiochus' favorite brother.\nIt is hard to say when Pelagius' madness first manifested itself, for, in truth, the first ten years of his life were marked by much insanity in the land itself. When Pelagius was just over a year old, Antiochus died and a daughter, Kintyra, assumed the throne to the acclaim of all. Kintyra II was Pelagius' cousin and an accomplished mystic and sorceress. If she had sufficient means to peer into the future, she would have surely fled the palace.\nThe story of the War of the Red Diamond has been told in many other scholarly journals, but as most historians agree, Kintyra II's reign was usurped by her and Pelagius' cousin Uriel, by the power of his mother, Potema -- the so-called wolf queen of Solitude. The year after her coronation, Kintyra was trapped in Glenpoint and imprisoned in the Imperial dungeons there.\nAll of Tamriel exploded into warfare as Prince Uriel took the throne as Uriel III, and High Rock, because of the imprisoned Empress' presence there, was the location of some of the bloodiest battles. Pelagius' father, King Magnus, allied himself with his brother Cephorus against the usurper Emperor, and brought the wrath of Uriel III and Queen Potema down on Wayrest. Pelagius, his brothers and sisters, and his mother Utheilla fled to the Isle of Balfiera. Utheilla was of the line of Direnni, and her family manse is still located on that ancient isle even to this day.\nThere is thankfully much written record of Pelagius' childhood in Balfiera recorded by nurses and visitors. All who met him described him as a handsome, personable boy, interested in sport, magic, and music. Even assuming diplomats' lack of candor, Pelagius seemed, if anything, a blessing to the future of the Septim Dynasty.\nWhen Pelagius was eight, Cephorus slew Uriel III at the Battle of Ichidag and proclaimed himself Emperor Cephorus I. For the next ten years of his reign, Cephorus battled Potema. Pelagius' first battle was the Siege of Solitude, which ended with Potema's death and the final end of the war. In gratitude, Cephorus placed Pelagius on the throne of Solitude.\nAs king of Solitude, Pelagius' eccentricities of behavior began to be noticeable. As a favorite nephew of the Emperor, few diplomats to Solitude made critical commentary about Pelagius. For the first two years of his reign, Pelagius was at the very least noted for his alarming shifts in weight. Four months after taking the throne, a diplomat from Ebonheart called Pelagius \"a hale and hearty soul with a heart so big, it widens his waist\"; five months after that, the visiting princess of Firsthold wrote to her brother that \"the king's gripped my hand and it felt like I was being clutched by a skeleton. Pelagius is greatly emaciated, indeed.\"\nCephorus never married and died childless three years after the Siege of Solitude. As the only surviving sibling, Pelagius' father Magnus left the throne of Wayrest and took residence at the Imperial City as the Emperor Magnus I. Magnus was elderly and Pelagius was his oldest living child, so the attention of Tamriel focused on Sentinel. By this time, Pelagius' eccentricities were becoming infamous.\nThere are many legends about his acts as King of Sentinel, but few well-documented cases exist. It is known that Pelagius locked the young princes and princesses of Silvenar in his room with him, only releasing them when an unsigned Declaration of War was slipped under the door. When he tore off his clothes during a speech he was giving at a local festival, his advisors apparently decided to watch him more carefully. On the orders of Magnus, Pelagius was married to the beautiful heiress of an ancient Dark Elf noble family, Katariah Ra'athim.\nNordic kings who marry Dark Elves seldom improve their popularity. There are two reasons most scholars give for the union. Magnus was trying to cement relations with Ebonheart, where the Ra'athim clan hailed. Ebonheart's neighbor, Mournhold, had been a historical ally of the Empire since the very beginning, and the royal consort of Queen Barenziah had won many battles in the War of the Red Diamond. Ebonheart had a poorly-kept secret of aiding Uriel III and Potema.\nThe other reason for the marriage was more personal: Katariah was as shrewd a diplomat as she was beautiful. If any creature was capable of hiding Pelagius' madness, it was she.\nOn the 8th of Second Seed, 3E 145, Magnus I died quietly in his sleep. Jolethe, Pelagius' sister took over the throne of Solitude, and Pelagius and Katariah rode to the Imperial City to be crowned Emperor and Empress of Tamriel. It is said that Pelagius fainted when the crown was placed on his head, but Katariah held him up so only those closest to the thrones could see what had happened. Like so many Pelagius stories, this cannot be verified.\nPelagius III never truly ruled Tamriel. Katariah and the Elder Council made all the decisions and only tried to keep Pelagius from embarrassing all. Still, stories of Pelagius III's reign exist.\nIt was said that when the Argonian ambassador from Blackrose came to court, Pelagius insisted on speaking in all grunts and squeaks, as that was the Argonian's natural language.\nIt is known that Pelagius was obsessed with cleanliness, and many guests reported waking to the noise of an early-morning scrubdown of the Imperial Palace. The legend of Pelagius while inspecting the servants' work, suddenly defecating on the floor to give them something to do, is probably apocryphal.\nWhen Pelagius began actually biting and attacking visitors to the Imperial Palace, it was decided to send him to a private asylum. Katariah was proclaimed regent two years after Pelagius took the throne. For the next six years, the Emperor stayed in a series of institutions and asylums.\nTraitors to the Empire have many lies to spread about this period. Whispered stories of hideous experiments and tortures performed on Pelagius have almost become accepted as fact. The noble lady Katariah became pregnant shortly after the Emperor was sent away, and rumors of infidelity and, even more absurd, conspiracies to keep the sane Emperor locked away, ran amok. As Katariah proved, her pregnancy came about after a visit to her husband's cell. With no other evidence, as loyal subjects, we are bound to accept the Empress' word on the matter. Her second child, who would reign for many years as Uriel IV, was the child of her union with her consort Lariate, and publicly acknowledged as such.\nOn a warm night in Suns Dawn, in his 34th year, Pelagius III died after a brief fever in his cell at the Temple of Kynareth in the Isle of Betony. Katariah I reigned for another forty six years before passing the scepter onto the only child she had with Pelagius, Cassynder.\nPelagius' wild behavior has made him perversely dear to the province of his birth and death. The 2nd of Suns Dawn, which may or may not be the anniversary of his death (records are not very clear) is celebrated as Mad Pelagius, the time when foolishness of all sorts is encouraged. And so, one of the least desirable Emperors in the history of the Septim Dynasty, has become one of the most famous ones.\n"

    "text": "\"In Mundus, conflict and disparity are what bring change, and change is the most sacred of the Eleven Forces. Change is the force without focus or origin.\"-Oegnithr, Taheritae, Order of PSJJJJ\n\nSimply put, the schism in the Human/Aldmeri worldview is the mortal's relationship to the divine. Humans take the humble path that they were created by the immortal forces, while the Aldmer claim descent from them. It doesn't seem like much, but it is a distinction that colors the rest of their diverging mythologies.\nAll Tamrielic religions begin the same. Man or mer, things begin with the dualism of Anu and His Other. These twin forces go by many names: Anu-Padomay, Anuiel-Sithis, Ak-El, Satak-Akel, Is-Is Not. Anuiel is the Everlasting Ineffable Light, Sithis is the Corrupting Inexpressible Action. In the middle is the Gray Maybe ('Nirn' in the Ehlnofex).\nIn most cultures, Anuiel is honored for his part of the interplay that creates the world, but Sithis is held in highest esteem because he's the one that causes the reaction. Sithis is thus the Original Creator, an entity who intrinsically causes change without design. Even the hist acknowledge this being.\nAnuiel is also perceived of as Order, opposed to the Sithis-Chaos. Perhaps it is easier for mortals to envision change than perfect stasis, for often Anuiel is relegated to the mythic background of Sithis' fancies. In Yokudan folk-tales, which are among the most vivid in the world, Satak is only referred to a handful of times, as \"the Hum\"; he is a force so prevalent as to be not really there at all.\nIn any case, from these two beings spring the et'Ada, or Original Spirits. To humans these et'Ada are the Gods and Demons; to the Aldmer, the Aedra/Daedra, or the 'Ancestors'. All of the Tamrielic pantheons fill their rosters from these et'Ada, though divine membership often differs from culture to culture. Like Anu and Padomay, though, every one of these pantheons contains the archetypes of the Dragon God and the Missing God.\n\nThe Dragon God and the Missing God\nThe Dragon God is always related to Time, and is universally revered as the \"First God.\" He is often called Akatosh, \"whose perch from Eternity allowed the day.\" He is the central God of the Cyrodilic Empire.\nThe Missing God is always related to the Mortal Plane, and is a key figure in the Human/Aldmeri schism. The 'missing' refers to either his palpable absence from the pantheon (another mental distress that is interpreted a variety of ways), or the removal of his 'divine spark' by the other immortals. He is often called Lorkhan, and his epitaphs are many, equally damnable and devout.\nNote that Tamriel and the Mortal Plane do not exist yet. The Gray Maybe is still the playground of the Original Spirits. Some are more bound to Anu's light, others to the unknowable void. Their constant flux and interplay increase their number, and their personalities take long to congeal. When Akatosh forms, Time begins, and it becomes easier for some spirits to realize themselves as beings with a past and a future. The strongest of the recognizable spirits crystallize: Mephala, Arkay, Y'ffre, Magnus, Rupgta, etc., etc. Others remain as concepts, ideas, or emotions. One of the strongest of these, a barely formed urge that the others call Lorkhan, details a plan to create Mundus, the Mortal Plane.\nHumans, with the exception of the Redguards, see this act as a divine mercy, an enlightenment whereby lesser creatures can reach immortality. Aldmer, with the exception of the Dark Elves, see this act as a cruel deception, a trick that sundered their connection to the spirit plane.\n\nThe Myth of Aurbis\nSubtitled \"The Psijiic Compensation,\" \"Mythic Aurbis\" was an attempt by Artaeum apologists to explain the basics of Aldmeri religion to Uriel V in the early, glorious part of his reign. It quietly avoided any blame or bias against the Lorkhan-concept, which was still held in esteem by the Cyrodiils as \"Shezarr\", the missing sibling of the Divines. Despite this, the Psijiici still give a nice summary of the Elder view, and it will serve our purposes here. This version comes from the archives of the Imperial Seminary from the handwritten notes of an unknown scribe.\nMythic Aurbis exists, and has existed from time without measure, as a fanciful Unnatural Realm.\n'Aurbis' is used to connote the imperceptible Penumbra, the Gray Center between the IS/IS NOT of Anu and Padomay. It contains the multitude realms of Aetherius and Oblivion, as well as other, less structured forms.\nThe magical beings of Mythic Aurbis live for a long time and have complex narrative lives, creating the patterns of myth.\nThese are spirits made from bits of the immortal polarity. The first of these was Akatosh the Time Dragon, whose formation made it easier for other spirits to structure themselves. Gods and demons form and reform and procreate.\nFinally, the magical beings of Mythic Aurbis told the ultimate story -- that of their own death. For some this was an artistic transfiguration into the concrete, non-magical substance of the world. For others, this was a war in which all were slain, their bodies becoming the substance of the world. For yet others, this was a romantic marriage and parenthood, with the parent spirits naturally having to die and give way to the succeeding mortal races.\nThe agent of this communal decision was Lorkhan, whom most early myths vilify as a trickster or deceiver. More sympathetic versions of this story point out Lorkhan as being the reason the mortal plane exists at all.\nThe magical beings created the races of the mortal Aurbis in their own image, either consciously as artists and craftsmen, or as the fecund rotting matter out of which the mortals sprung forth, or in a variety of other analogical senses.\nThe magical beings, then, having died, became the et'Ada. The et'Ada are the things perceived and revered by the mortals as gods, spirits, or geniuses of Aurbis. Through their deaths, these magical beings separated themselves in nature from the other magical beings of the Unnatural realms.\nThe Daedra were created at this time also, being spirits and Gods more attuned to Oblivion, or that realm closer to the Void of Padomay. This act is the dawn of the Mythic (Merethic) Era. It has been perceived by the earliest mortals many different ways, either as a joyous 'second creation', or (especially by the Elves) as a painful fracturing from the divine. The originator of the event is always Lorkhan.\n\nLorkhan\nThis Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every Tamrielic mythic tradition. His most popular name is the Aldmeri \"Lorkhan,\" or Doom Drum. He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the Mortal Plane, upsetting the status quo much like his father Padomay had introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhan is separated from his divine center, sometimes involuntarily, and wanders the creation of the et'Ada. Interpretations of these events differ widely by culture. Below are some of the better known:\n\nYokudan, \"Satakal the Worldskin\"\n\"Satak was First Serpent, the Snake who came Before, and all the worlds to come rested in the glimmer of its scales. But it was so big there was nothing but, and thus it was coiled around and around itself, and the worlds to come slid across each other but none had room to breathe or even be. And so the worlds called to something to save them, to let them out, but of course there was nothing outside the First Serpent, so aid had to come from inside it; this was Akel, the Hungry Stomach. Akel made itself known, and Satak could only think about what it was, and it was the best hunger, so it ate and ate. Soon there was enough room to live in the worlds and things began. These things were new and they often made mistakes, for there was hardly time to practice being things before. So most things ended quickly or were not good or gave up on themselves. Some things were about to start, but they were eaten up as Satak got to that part of its body. This was a violent time.\n\"Pretty soon Akel caused Satak to bite its own heart and that was the end. The hunger, though, refused to stop, even in death, and so the First Serpent shed its skin to begin anew. As the old world died, Satakal began, and when things realized this pattern so did they realize what their part in it was. They began to take names, like Ruptga or Tuwhacca, and they strode about looking for their kin. As Satakal ate itself over and over, the strongest spirits learned to bypass the cycle by moving at strange angles. They called this process the Walkabout, a way of striding between the worldskins. Ruptga was so big that he was able to place the stars in the sky so that weaker spirits might find their way easier. This practice became so easy for the spirits that it became a place, called the Far Shores, a time of waiting until the next skin.\n\"Ruptga was able to sire many children through the cycles and so he became known as the Tall Papa. He continued to place stars to map out the void for others, but after so many cycles there were almost too many spirits to help out. He made himself a helper from the detritus of past skins and this was Sep, or Second Serpent. Sep had much of the Hungry Stomach still left in him, multiple hungers from multiple skins. He was so hungry he could not think straight. Sometimes he would just eat the spirits he was supposed to help, but Tall Papa would always reach in and take them back out. Finally, tired of helping Tall Papa, Sep went and gathered the rest of the old skins and balled them up, tricking spirits to help him, promising them this was how you reached the new world, by making one out of the old. These spirits loved this way of living, as it was easier. No more jumping from place to place. Many spirits joined in, believing this was good thinking. Tall Papa just shook his head.\n\"Pretty soon the spirits on the skin-ball started to die, because they were very far from the real world of Satakal. And they found that it was too far to jump into the Far Shores now. The spirits that were left pleaded with Tall Papa to take them back. But grim Ruptga would not, and he told the spirits that they must learn new ways to follow the stars to the Far Shores now. If they could not, then they must live on through their children, which was not the same as before. Sep, however, needed more punishment, and so Tall Papa squashed the Snake with a big stick. The hunger fell out of Sep's dead mouth and was the only thing left of the Second Serpent. While the rest of the new world was allowed to strive back to godhood, Sep could only slink around in a dead skin, or swim about in the sky, a hungry void that jealously tried to eat the stars.\"\n\nCyrodilic \"\"Shezarr's Song\"\"\n\"This was a new thing that Shezarr described to the Gods, becoming mothers and fathers, being responsible, and making great sacrifices, with no guarantee of success, but Shezarr spoke beautifully to them, and moved them beyond mystery and tears. Thus the Aedra gave free birth to the world, the beasts, and the beings, making these things from parts of themselves. This free birth was very painful, and afterwards the Aedra were no longer young, and strong, and powerful, as they had been from the beginning of days.\n\"Some Aedra were disappointed and bitter in their loss, and angry with Shezarr, and with all creation, for they felt Shezarr had lied and tricked them. These Aedra, the Gods of the Aldmer, led by Auri-El, were disgusted by their enfeebled selves, and by what they had created. 'Everything is spoiled, for now, and for all time, and the most we can do is teach the Elven Races to suffer nobly, with dignity, and chastise ourselves for our folly, and avenge ourselves upon Shezarr and his allies.' Thus are the Gods of the Elves dark and brooding, and thus are the Elves ever dissatisfied with mortality, and always proud and stoic despite the harshness of this cruel and indifferent world.\n\"Other Aedra looked upon creation, and were well pleased. These Aedra, the Gods of Men and Beast Folk, led by Akatosh, praised and cherished their wards, the Mortal Races. 'We have suffered, and are diminished, for all time, but the mortal world we have made is glorious, filling our hearts and spirits with hope. Let us teach the Mortal Races to live well, to cherish beauty and honor, and to love one another as we love them.' Thus are the Gods of Men tender and patient, and thus are Men and Beast Folk great in heart for joy or suffering, and ambitious for greater wisdom and a better world.\n\"Now when the Daedra Lords heard Shezarr, they mocked him, and the other Aedra. 'Cut parts of ourselves off? And lose them? Forever? That's stupid! You'll be sorry! We are far smarter than you, for we will create a new world out of ourselves, but we will not cut it off, or let it mock us, but we will make this world within ourselves, forever ours, and under our complete control.'\n\"So the Daedra Lords created the Daedric Realms, and all the ranks of Lesser Daedra, great and small. And, for the most part, the Daedra Lords were well pleased with this arrangement, for they always had worshippers and servants and playthings close to hand. But, at the same time, they sometimes looked with envy upon the Mortal Realms, for though mortals were foul and feeble and contemptible, their passions and ambitions were also far more surprising and entertaining than the antics of the Lesser Daedra. Thus do the Daedra Lords court and seduce certain amusing specimens of the Mortal Races, especially the passionate and powerful. It gives the Daedra Lords special pleasure to steal away from Shezarr and the Aedra the greatest and most ambitious mortals. 'Not only are you fools to mutilate yourselves,' gloat the Daedra Lords, 'But you cannot even keep the best pieces, which prefer the glory and power of the Daedra Lords to the feeble vulgarity of the mush-minded Aedra.'\"\n\nAltmeri \"The Heart of the World\"\n\"Anu encompassed, and encompasses, all things. So that he might know himself he created Anuiel, his soul and the soul of all things. Anuiel, as all souls, was given to self-reflection, and for this he needed to differentiate between his forms, attributes, and intellects. Thus was born Sithis, who was the sum of all the limitations Anuiel would utilize to ponder himself. Anuiel, who was the soul of all things, therefore became many things, and this interplay was and is the Aurbis.\n\"At first the Aurbis was turbulent and confusing, as Anuiel's ruminations went on without design. Aspects of the Aurbis then asked for a schedule to follow or procedures whereby they might enjoy themselves a little longer outside of perfect knowledge. So that he might know himself this way, too, Anu created Auriel, the soul of his soul. Auriel bled through the Aurbis as a new force, called time. With time, various aspects of the Aurbis began to understand their natures and limitations. They took names, like Magnus or Mara or Xen. One of these, Lorkhan, was more of a limit than a nature, so he could never last long anywhere.\n\"As he entered every aspect of Anuiel, Lorkhan would plant an idea that was almost wholly based on limitation. He outlined a plan to create a soul for the Aurbis, a place where the aspects of aspects might even be allowed to self-reflect. He gained many followers; even Auriel, when told he would become the king of the new world, agreed to help Lorkhan. So they created the Mundus, where their own aspects might live, and became the et'Ada.\n\"But this was a trick. As Lorkhan knew, this world contained more limitations than not and was therefore hardly a thing of Anu at all. Mundus was the House of Sithis. As their aspects began to die off, many of the et'Ada vanished completely. Some escaped, like Magnus, and that is why there are no limitations to magic. Others, like Y'ffre, transformed themselves into the Ehlnofey, the Earthbones, so that the whole world might not die. Some had to marry and make children just to last. Each generation was weaker than the last, and soon there were Aldmer. Darkness caved in. Lorkhan made armies out of the weakest souls and named them Men, and they brought Sithis into every quarter.\n\"Auriel pleaded with Anu to take them back, but he had already filled their places with something else. But his soul was gentler and granted Auriel his Bow and Shield, so that he might save the Aldmer from the hordes of Men. Some had already fallen, like the Chimer, who listened to tainted et'Ada, and others, like the Bosmer, had soiled Time's line by taking Mannish wives.\n\"Auriel could not save Altmora, the Elder Wood, and it was lost to Men. They were chased south and east to Old Ehlnofey, and Lorkhan was close behind. He shattered that land into many. Finally Trinimac, Auriel's greatest knight, knocked Lorkhan down in front of his army and reached in with more than hands to take his Heart. He was undone. The Men dragged Lorkhan's body away and swore blood vengeance on the heirs of Auriel for all time.\n\"But when Trinimac and Auriel tried to destroy the Heart of Lorkhan it laughed at them. It said, \"This Heart is the heart of the world, for one was made to satisfy the other.\" So Auriel fastened the thing to an arrow and let it fly long into the sea, where no aspect of the new world may ever find it.\""

    "description": "A history of the Night Mother",
    "text": "\nAlthough various works have been written on the subjects of both Morrowind's Morag Tong, and Tamriel's more widespread Dark Brotherhood, there remains confusion as to precisely when and how these two feared assassins guilds formed. Or, more specifically, when and how the Dark Brotherhood split from the Morag Tong, as the former is widely accepted to have sprung from the latter.\nThe largest point of contention seems to be the figure of the Night Mother, a woman who figures prominently in both organizations. Through extensive research and interviews, and not inconsiderable risk to my own life (for the Dark Brotherhood holds this information sacred), I have finally solved this ages-old mystery. I have finally uncovered the Night Mother's Truth.\nAlthough her name has been lost to time, the Night Mother was once a mere mortal, a Dark Elf woman who lived in a small village once located where the city of Bravil stands now, in the Imperial Province of Cyrodiil. She was a respected member of the Morag Tong and, like her fellow members, this woman made her trade as an assassin in service to the Daedric Prince Mephala. In fact, the woman held the title of Night Mother, reserved for the highest ranking female member of the organization. To be Night Mother of a particular sect was to be that group's matron - the favored of Mephala, both respected and feared.\nHowever, it was not Mephala who facilitated the transformation from woman to spectre, but another, some would say far deeper form of evil - Sithis, the Dread Lord, embodiment of the unending Void.\nFollowing the Potentate's assassination in 2E 324, strife descended upon the Morag Tong, and the guild was all but eradicated in Cyrodiil and much of the Empire. It was shortly after these events that the Dunmer woman claimed to hear the voice of Sithis himself. The Dread Lord, she claimed, was displeased. He was unhappy with the Morag Tong's lack of success. The Void, he told her, was hungry for souls - and it was her destiny to set things right.\nAnd so, according to Dark Brotherhood legend, Sithis visited the Night Mother in her bed chamber, and begat her five children. Two years passed, before the unthinkable happened. The Dark Elf woman followed through with the Dread Lord's ultimate plan - one night, she murdered her children, and sent their souls straight to the Void. Straight to their father.\nWhen they learned of this affront to decency, the people of the village rallied against the woman. For such an act was considered incomprehensible, even for a Night Mother of the Morag Tong. In one night of vengeance, they descended upon the woman, killing her, and burning down the house in which the atrocity took place. And that was the end of the story. Or so everyone thought.\nA little more than thirty years later, an unnamed man heard a strange, comforting voice inside his very head, just as the Dunmer woman claimed to hear the voice of Sithis inside hers. The voice identified herself as the Night Mother, and named the man \"Listener\" - the first of many.\nAnd so the Unholy Matron set her servant on his path - he would found a new organization, a guild of assassins known as the Dark Brotherhood, in service not to Mephala, but to the Dread Lord Sithis. The Morag Tong, now surviving only in Morrowind, was an artifact of a forgotten age. The Dark Brotherhood would marry business with death. The organization would grow in wealth and power, and the Void would swell with fresh souls. It was, the Night Mother told her Listener, the perfect arrangement.\nIn the early days of the Dark Brotherhood, the bodies of the Night Mother and her children were recovered from their original burial site, and interred in a crypt beneath the site of her house. And there they remain, even today.\nSo if, in your travels, you find yourself in the city of Bravil, and make a wish at the statue of the Lucky Old Lady (as is the local custom), know that you stand on sacred, if evil, ground. For you stand above the Night Mother, the Unholy Matron herself, and your luck has just run out."

    "text": "We who know the Old Ways are well aware of the existence of a spiritual world invisible to the unenlightened. Just as one living in a kingdom but unaware of the political machinations underneath may see a new tax or battle preparation as the caprices of fortune, many observe floods, famines, and madness with helpless incomprehension. This is deplorable. As the great Cuilean Darnizhaan moaned, \"The power of ignorance can shatter ebony like glass.\"\nWhat, after all, is the origin of these spiritual forces that move the invisible strings of Mundus? Any neophyte of Artaeum knows that these spirits are our ancestors -- and that, while living, they too were bewildered by the spirits of their ancestors, and so on back to the original Acharyai. The Daedra and gods to whom the common people turn are no more than the spirits of superior men and women whose power and passion granted them great influence in the afterworld.\nCertainly this is our truth and our religion. But how does it help us in our sacred duty of seliffrnsae, or providing \"grave and faithful counsel\" to lesser men?\nPrimarily, it is easy to grasp the necessity both of endowing good men with great power and making powerful men good. We recognize the multiple threats that a strong tyrant represents -- breeds cruelty which feeds the Daedra Boethiah and hatred which feeds the Daedra Vaernima; if he should die having performed a particularly malevolent act, he may go to rule in Oblivion; and worst of all, he inspires other villains to thirst after power and other rulers to embrace villainy. Knowing this, we have developed patience in our dealings with such despots. They should be crippled, humiliated, impoverished, imprisoned. Other counsellors may advocate assassination or warfare -- which, aside from its spiritual insignificance, is expensive and likely to inflict at least as much pain on the innocents as the brutish dictator. No, we are intelligence gatherers, dignified diplomats -- not revolutionaries.\nHow, then, are our counsellors \"faithful\"? We are faithful only to the Old Ways -- it is essential always to remember the spiritual world while keeping our eyes open in the physical one. Performing the Rites of Moawita on the 2nd of Hearth Fire and the Vigyld on the 1st of Second Seed are essential means of empowering salutary spirits and debilitating unclean ones. How, then, are we at once faithful to those we counsel and to the Isle of Artaeum? Perhaps the sage Taheritae said it best: \"In Mundus, conflict and disparity are what bring change, and change is the most sacred of the Eleven Forces. Change is the force without focus or origin. It is the duty of the disciplined Psijic [\"Enlightened One\"] to dilute change where it brings greed, gluttony, sloth, ignorance, prejudice, cruelty... [here Taheritae lists the rest of the 111 Prodigalities], and to encourage change where it brings excellence, beauty, happiness, and enlightenment. As such, the faithful counsel has but one master: His mind. If the man the Psijic counsels acts wickedly and brings oegnithr [\"bad change\"] and will otherwise not be counselled, it is the Psijic's duty to counterbalance the oegnithr by any means necessary [emphasis mine].\"\nA student of the Old Ways may indeed ally himself to a lord -- but it is a risky relationship. It cannot be stressed enough that the choice be wisely made. Should the lord refuse wise counsel and order the Psijic (to use Taheritae's outmoded word) to perform an act contrary to the teachings of the Old Ways, there are few available options. The Psijic may obey, albeit unwillingly, and fall prey to the dark forces against which he has devoted his life. The Psijic may abandon his lord, which will bring shame on him and the Isle of Artaeum, and so may never be allowed home again. Or the Psijic may simply kill himself."

Whatever foul and pestilent Daedra of Oblivion conjured them up could scarcely have created a more constant threat to the well-being of the civilized races of Tamriel than the obnoxious Orc.\nOrcs are thankfully easy to recognize from other humanoids by their size -- commonly forty pertans in height and fifteen thousand angaids in weight -- their brutal pig-like features, and their stench. They are consistently belligerent, morally grotesque, intellectually moronic, and unclean. By all rights, the civilized races of Tamriel should have been able to purge the land of their blight eras ago, but their ferocity, animal cunning, and curious tribal loyalty have made them inevitable as leeches in a stagnant pool.\nTales of Orcish barbarity precede written record. When Jastyaga wrote of the Order of Diagna's joining the armies of Daggerfall and Sentinel \"to hold at bay the wicked Orcs in their foul Orsinium fastness... and burn aught in cleansing flame\" in 1E950, she assumed that any reader would be aware of the savagery of the Orcs. When the siege was completed thirty years later, after the death of many heroes including Gaiden Shinji, and the destruction of Orsinium scattered the Orcish survivors throughout the Wrothgarian Mountains, she further wrote, \"The free peoples rejoiced for that their ancient fell enemy was dispersed into diverse parts.\" Obviously, the Orcs had been terrorizing the region of the Iliac Bay at least since the early years of the First Era."

    "text": "The Reclamations:\n\tThe Fall of the Tribunal and the Rise of the New Temple\nby\n\tThara of Rihad\nThe destruction of Vivec City and the subsequent eruption of Red Mountain in 4E 5 was not just a crisis in terms of the physical destruction it caused - it also cut deeply into the ancient religious beliefs of the Dunmer. The fall of the Ministry of Truth was the last straw in the tottering support for the Temple's worship of Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and Vivec. With all three of the Tribunes now widely believed dead or disappeared, what had been a simmering schism within the ranks of the Temple priesthood burst into the open.\nWhile outsiders may never know the full tale of this internal struggle, when the smoke cleared a few years later, the former Dissident Priests were in full control of the Temple heirarchy, with Tribunal loyalists either purged or recanted. The so-called \"New Temple\" now declared the worship of the Tribunes a result of misguided teaching, blaming the mistakes on the former Tribunal. The Temple now taught that the daedra venerated by the Ashlander tribes (Azura, Mephala and Boethia) were the \"true way\" and should be revered by the Dunmer people. Fittingly, the daedra were named the \"Reclamations,\" as if they were reclaiming their status from the Tribunal.\nIn an elegant comprise, no doubt intended to reconcile the large majority of the Temple priesthood who were neither Dissidents nor fanatic Tribunal loyalists, Almalexia, Sotha Sil and Vivec were relegated to the status of \"saints,\" a traditional way to venerate the most honored Dunmer ancestors. This apparently satisfied enough of the existing priesthood that the New Temple was able to maintain at least a semblance of outward continuity.\nThe rise of the New Temple almost completely vindicated the previously persecuted Ashlanders, who had continued to worship the three daedra throughout the Tribunal's rule. The Ashlanders are now lauded as the keepers of the old ways and having \"true vision.\" It is now quite common for many of the Dunmer people to make the arduous pilgrimages into the ash wastes to seek the counsel of the Wise Women. These women have supposedly opened the eyes of those who they claim were \"blinded by the Tribunal,\" and directly connect the eruption of the Red Mountain and the Argonian invasion to the anger of the three daedra.\nHouse Indoril, whose fortunes were so entwined with the Tribunal Temple, suffered greatly from its fall. While House Indoril still technically exists, the priesthood of the Temple are now considered one and the same with House Indoril - those who become priests are now considered to have \"joined Indoril.\" The political power of the Indoril has thus passed entirely into the hands of the Temple (although members of the old House Indoril are still over-represented in the priesthood).\nThe rise of the New Temple has a number of interesting parallels with the rise of House Redoran - each filled the vacuum of power resulting from the crisis of Red Year. How durable these new arrangements will prove, religious and political, remains to be seen. The span of two centuries is quite brief in the long history of the ancient Dunmer people."

So what began as a chronicle of one of the worst events in the history of Morrowind became something altogether different, the celebration of a people who can never be defeated.\nDrallin Vess\n\tTear\n\"The ground... it just turned into mush. There was almost no warning. I mean, we were what... perhaps a mile from the nearest swamps? It was like the swamp suddenly swallowed up half of the city.\"\nI asked him to describe what happened from the beginning.\n\"I owned a farm just outside of Tear at the time. We were planting the next season's crops and getting ready to store what we had harvested. Everything was going well until the Red Mountain exploded. Almost immediately, the ground rumbled and shook. Cracks started forming everywhere and then the water just started seeping through. It was awful. In a matter of hours, I was knee-deep in swamp water running for my life. Where I was running, I had no idea. At first I ran towards the city itself, but it looked like the walls were cracking. All around me, people were desperately trying to save their livestock and their families from the rising water. Just when the ground shaking finally died down, and I had a moment to think, there was a horrible cracking noise. I'll never forget it, because I knew what it was before I looked. The entire southern wall of Tear collapsed sending guards tumbling into the swamp. I heard people screaming as they were covered by the rubble and forced down into the water. Forgetting my own problems, I looked over at my fellow farmers who were all staring at the carnage unfolding before us. Suddenly, we all just forgot our own problems and ran to help. There must have been hundreds of the poorer folks who lived outside the walls helping the richer ones who lived in the city. Never saw anything like that. I think we must have saved hundreds more that day.\"\nNeria Relethyl\n\tGnisis\nNeria was badly burned by the eruption, and had trouble speaking to me. She is currently convalescing at the Temple of Azura in Blacklight even after all these years. I've tried to record her story to the best of my ability.\n\"It was such a terrible thing... the fire. It burned everything in its path. It flattened trees, turned our huts into splinters and knocked over towers like they were made from parchment. It all happened in an instant. A rumbling sound, then a massive wall of flame... it was so high it blocked out the sun. I thought that the world itself had split apart. It passed over the water and turned it to steam... vaporized everything it touched. When it finally hit us, I was blown off of my feet... didn't even have time to run away or seek shelter. I ended up in the riverbed next to town, which kept some of the flames off of me. All around... could smell the charred stench of death. There were Dunmer that were burned alive and some never even saw it coming. I lay in that riverbed for two days before the healers found me. When I could finally stand, Gnisis was gone. There wasn't a thing left... it's as though it was wiped from the face of Tamriel.\"\nThe Red Year, Vol. II\nThe Red Year\n\tVolume II\nby\n\tMelis Ravel\n\nForeword\nWhen I originally decided to write this accounting of the Red Year, I elected to travel across Morrowind and speak to the Dunmer people themselves.

So what began as a chronicle of one of the worst events in the history of Morrowind became something altogether different, the celebration of a people who can never be defeated.\nSaldus Llervu\n\tVivec City\n\"I was a trader back then. Ran a pack guar from Vivec City clear down to Narsis. I was walking along the south road when the strangest thing happened. All of the noise around me stopped... the normal things one hears as they travel like the sound of the wind blowing through the treetops. It was just deathly quiet. I felt a tingling sensation all over my body and my guar began to stomp around. Whatever it was, it was driving him crazy. As I tried to get him under control, there was a massive explosion from the center of the city. I saw the cantons fall apart before I was knocked off my feet. Then I remember the ground starting to rumble. It lasted for a long time and it receded into the distance as if directed towards the center of Vvardenfell. A few minutes later, the Red Mountain erupted, sending a huge cloud of fire into the sky. My pack guar had long since fled, and I decided I should do the same. I never stopped running until I reached Narsis.\"\nI asked him if he knew what had happened Vivec City.\n\"I didn't hear until much later that the Ministry of Truth had struck the heart of the city. What I do know for certain is that many Dunmer lost their lives that day and that Vivec City is no more.\"\nDeros Dran\n\tMournhold\n\"The Red Year didn't heavily affect Mournhold itself, but it touched many of the people who lived there. A lot of us had relatives somewhere on Vvardenfell, and after the first day that the eruption occurred we started receiving reports of widespread devastation in Vivec City, Sadrith Mora, Balmora and Ald'ruhn. I don't think a single night went by for months where you wouldn't hear someone openly weeping. It was a sad time for all of us.\"\nI asked if Mournhold had sustained any damage during the Red Year.\n\"I don't know why, but the destruction seemed to pass us by. A few Dunmer claimed that it was the Tribunal watching over us, but others claimed that the Tribunal was to blame for everything. I actually saw a few of those disagreements come to blows. It was a strange time.\"\nI got an interesting response from Deros regarding Mournhold's role during the Red Year.\n\"Relief efforts began almost a month after the mountain erupted. It was actually a directive that came from the House Redoran councilor that was living in Mournhold at the time. I can't remember his name, but he took charge of the situation and sent soldiers, supplies and able-bodied Dunmer to the outlying settlements that had been hit the hardest. I was sent to Balmora. The place was a mess; hardly anything left in town was still standing. I spent maybe two months there, helping to rebuild the town and getting my fellow Dunmer back on their feet. It started out as a burden, but it ended up being the most rewarding thing I'd ever done in my life. I started some friendships there that still last to this day, including my beloved wife.\""

    "text": "There are many that still remember the Blades. There are fewer that can pass down their stories, their origins and their downfall. My father could. In his proudest moments he said to me, \"You keep secrets like the Blades.\"\nThe Blades were good at keeping secrets. They didn't write down much. They passed information carefully between their spies in every province, to their elite members that protected the Emperors. Even amongst their members, they kept much secret.\nMost associate the Blades with their ceremonial Akaviri armor and curved longswords. One can trace the Blades back to the fiercest warriors of Akavir, the Dragonguard. It was there, just as they would do in Tamriel, that they protected rulers and their kingdom. But recent discoveries show it to be much more than that.\nMany classic texts tell us of adventures to Akavir, known as the dragon lands of the east. Many from Tamriel have attempted to conquer it, most famously Emperor Uriel V and his Tenth Legion in 3E288 as documented in the Imperial dispatch \"Disaster at Ionith.\" Dragons have long been legend in Akavir, and many believe that their brief appearance in Tamriel's history are those that escaped Akaviri, for it was there they were hunted and killed off by the Dragonguard. The Dragonguard would follow those that fled to Tamriel in the late 1st Era.\nInvading from the north, the Dragonguard met not only dragons, but the men of Skyrim, who don't meet invasions with pitchers of mead. The Dragonguard cut a path through Skyrim, and it was not until they were stopped by Reman Cyrodiil during the battle at Pale Pass that the invasion came to an end. It was Reman who united the human lands of Cyrodiil and defeated the Akaviri invaders.\nReman is one of the first documented, and widely accepted, of the mythic Dragonborn; those anointed by Akatosh and Alessia themselves. \"Born with the soul of a dragon\" is what his followers would say. Reports differ widely on the nature of the battle at Pale Pass. But the end result is the same, that the remaining Dragonguard, upon hearing the voice of Reman Cyrodiil, knelt and swore their lives to him, their conqueror and savior. Fragments of from late 1st era texts refer to the warriors dropping to their knees saying \"we were not hunting\" (or \"did not intend\", author - rough translation), continuing \"we have been searching, for you.\"\nThey protected Reman with their lives, as well as his descendants, as the Reman Dynasty ushered in Tamriel's 2nd era. It was through these years that their reach extended, and their order grew to become the Blades. Their conquest of the dragons complete, they only sought to protect the Dragonborn, and through him, the Empire.\nThey reached their height late during the 3rd era under the rule of the Septim emprors. Despite their numbers, they kept their secrecy. The most visible and well documented were the members who personally guarded the Emperor, still wearing the original Akaviri armor. But that was the just the tip of the spear, for the Blades were a larger organization, stretching to every corner of Tamriel. These agents were of every race. They were merchants, thieves, craftsman, mages, and warriors, all acting as spies, protecting the Empire as needed, and operating in secret. They often acted alone, but some fragments speak of them meeting in secret fortresses across the continent. The most famous being Cyrodiil's Cloud Ruler Temple, where they hung the swords of those slain protecting the Dragonborn. Other maps speak of Wind Scour Temple under the great expanse of Hammerfell's Alik'r desert, Sky Haven Temple in the mountains of Skyrim, and Storm Talon Temple east of Wayrest.\nThey were known to have a \"Grandmaster\", who often lived amongst the people, unknown to others. The nature of their communications, meeting places, and missions were known to only a few elite members. The only two to know all were the Grandmaster himself and the Chronicler, whose only job was to make sure the group's mission was never known, but never lost.\nWith the death of Uriel Septim VII and his son, Martin, the 3rd era came to a close with the Blades fortifying themselves deep within Cyrodiil's Cloud Ruler Temple, as they waited for a Dragonborn to return when they would be called upon again.\nThe Empire of the 4th era no longer saw the Blades openly protecting it, or the Emperors. That role is now filled by the Penitus Oculatus, a purely Imperial organization. But the Blades continued their secret work, to watch for the Dragonborn and guard against future enemies. The Blades were among the first to see the signs that the Thalmor of the Aldmeri Dominion would not remain isolated within their borders forever. They could do what the Penitus Oculatus, servant to Imperial policy, could not, and thus earned the lasting hatred of the Thalmor.\nThe warnings of the Blades were proved right, as is well known to all. The Great War between the Empire and the Thalmor consumed the Empire and nearly destroyed it. Emperor Titus Mede II eventually brokered peace with the Thalmor, but at a price many of us still bear.\nThe reach and destructive nature of the Thalmor is known to many (author's note - in my family firsthand). They are not fools. They knew early on that the Blades were an enemy. So they hunted them throughout the Great War. Some were killed defending their Temples, others as they slept in their hideaways, alone.  Some fought, some ran, some hid. But the Thalmor found them all.\nThere are those that say the Blades still exist around us, in hiding from the Thalmor. Waiting as they have done time and time again, for a Dragonborn to return. For one to protect, for one to guide them."

    "text": "The Tale of Dro'Zira\n\tTranscription and Commentary\nby\n\tSonia Vette\nThe following is a tale overheard, as told by a Khajiit father to his cub, while making camp with one of their caravans. I have attempted to transcribe it as he told it, for the Khajiit do not often speak of their history to outsiders. In truth I do not believe he would have spoken at all, but for the vast helping of Moonsugar he had consumed that night.\nCome and warm your fur by the fire, Ma'rashirr, and I will tell you of how our Dro'Zira came to be the greatest of all Kahjiit! (ed: Dro'Zira I took in this case to be an honored ancestor)\nThe ancient Khajiit heard the great roar of Alkosh the Great Cat King of Time (ed: known as Akatosh in the empire, and Alduin in Skyrim) and raced to his Voice. In three days' time they crossed the whole of Tamriel, resting not even for the moonsugar, for such was the speed of Khajiiti then.\nThey joined with the pride of Alkosh and were his strongest warriors. Lorkhaj, (ed: Shor in the Nordic) however, chose to give his roar to the Ra'Wulfharth to spite the Khajiiti warriors, for he was jealous of their devotion to Alkosh.\nSeeing the ferocity of the Khajiiti warriors, Ra'Wulfharth could not bring himself to put them to death. Using the roar that Lorkhaj had given him, he spoke to Masser and Secunda, to move to their fullness in the sky. The Khajiiti warriors became Senche, but Lorkhaj stripped from them all reason.\nWhen Ra'Wulfharth returned to sink his fangs into the Red Mountain, he called upon his people to aid him. Dro'Zira was the only among the \"Rhojiit\" who still remembered, and so was the only one who answered the summons.\nBut these Nord bards are (expletive removed) and do not sing of how the great Ash King rode Dro'Zira up the Red Mountain itself to strike at the heart of the Dunmer. Never is it mentioned how Dro'Zira pounced atop Dumalacath, the Dwarf-Orc, when he had his blade to the throat of the Ash King so that he could not speak.\nNor do they sing of how Lorkhaj returned Dro'Zira from the lands of Sheggorath for his bravery and for saving the Ash King! So when you find a bard who speaks ill of the Khajiit, you be sure to leave him an iron claw in the back to remind him who saved Skyrim.\nAs for the rest of the \"Rhojiit\" They grew small and lost their cunning altogether, which is why you should not hesitate to strike them down when they approach the wagons. So it was told by my father, and so I tell it now to you.\nNow, be a good cub and go fetch me some more moonsugar for these sweet cakes.\nMuch of the tale seemed to me, little more than a boast, but certain facts do seem to line up with what we believe is the truth behind the legends. It does raise questions as to why we do not know more about history of the Khajiit and what parts they have played that might not have been recorded by our written histories."

    "text": "The Talos Mistake\n\nby\nLeonora Venatus\nImperial Liaison to the Aldmeri Dominion\n\nAs citizens of the Empire, all are of course familiar with the deeds of Emperor Tiber Septim. But it is the Emperor's ascent to godhood, as Talos, that is the subject of this work.\nUntil Tiber Septim's death, there had been but Eight Divines: Akatosh, Dibella, Arkay, Zenithar, Stendarr, Mara, Kynareth, and Julianos. These gods were, and are, worshipped throughout the Empire. And while some may have different names in the varying provinces (for example, Akatosh is known as \"Auri-El\" to the Aldmer; and Arkay is sometimes known as \"Ar'Kay\"), all are recognized and revered by all races and cultures of Tamriel.\nBut when Tiber Septim passed to Aetherius, there came to be a Ninth Divine - Talos, also called Ysmir, the \"Dragon of the North.\" The man who was so loved in life became worshipped in death. Indeed, it can be argued that Talos, the Ninth Divine, became even more important than the Eight that had preceded him, at least to humans. For he was a god who was once just a man, and through great deeds actually managed to ascend to godhood. And if one human could achieve such a feat - couldn't it be done again? Couldn't all humans aspire to achieve divinity?\nSo we thought, we humans. And so we continued to worship Talos, and revere him as the ultimate hero-god. But that was then. This is now. And now, we know the truth:\nWe were wrong.\nAs citizens of the Empire, we all experienced the horrors of the Great War. And it was not until the signing of the White-Gold Concordat, the treaty between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion, that we once again knew peace. One of the most important stipulations of that treaty, as every Imperial citizen is well aware, is that Talos can no longer be worshipped as a god. This edict shook the very foundations of the Empire. There were those who rebelled against the law. Indeed, some still do.\nBut the citizens of the Empire must know this: the Emperor did not agree to outlaw the worship of Talos because it was demanded by the Thalmor, the ruling body of the Aldmeri Dominion.\nThe Emperor agreed to the outlaw of the worship of Talos because it was the right thing to do.\nToday, the Emperor, and indeed the Empire itself, recognizes that allowing the worship of Talos was a mistake. For by doing so, by allowing the worship of Talos as a Divine, the Empire actually did its people a great disservice: for this only succeeded in weakening the memory of the man Tiber Septim and his many extraordinary (though mortal) deeds; and pushing people away from the Eight Divines, the true gods, who do deserve our love and reverence.\nAnd so, the Empire admits it was wrong. The Talos Mistake will not be repeated. May we find centuries of peace and prosperity with our new Thalmor friends, and continue to share a spirituality that binds together all the cultures and races of Tamriel."

History has mislabeled them beastfolk, related to the goblin races, but the Orcs are actually the children of Trinimac, strongest of the Altmeri ancestor spirits. When Trinimac was eaten by the Daedroth Prince Boethiah, and transformed in that foul god's insides, the Orcs were transformed as well. The ancient name for the Orcs is 'Orsimer,' which means 'The Pariah Folk.' They now follow Malauch, the remains of Trinimac.\nWho is Malauch?\nHe is more commonly know as the Daedroth Prince Malacath, 'whose sphere is the patronage of the spurned and ostracized, the sworn oath, and the bloody curse.' He is not technically a Daedra Lord, nor do the other Daedra recognize him as such, but this is fitting for his sphere. Of old he was Trinimac, the champion of the High Elven pantheon, in some places more popular than Auri-El, who protected them against enemies without and within. When Trinimac and his followers attempted to halt the Velothi dissident movement, Boethiah ate him. Trinimac's body and spirit were corrupted, and he emerged as Malacath. His followers were likewise changed for the worse. Despised by everyone, especially the inviolate Auri-El, they quickly fled to the northern wastes, near Saarthal. They fought Nords and Chimer for a place in the world, but did not get much. In Skyrim, Malacath is called Orkey, or Old Knocker, and his battles with Ysmir are legendary.\n"

One must follow the triune virtues of duty, gravity, and piety.\nA Redoran's duty is first to the Tribunal Temple, second to the Great House Redoran, and third to one's family and clan. In the Battle of Red Mountain, warriors of House Redoran died bravely for their duty to the Tribunal. By defending House Redoran from the schemes of Telvanni wizards and the lies of untrustworthy Hlaalu, the true noble shows duty to House Redoran. Following the Temple's guidelines of mercy and generosity show duty to one's family and clan.\nA Redoran noble must know the virtue of gravity. It is not the Redoran way to laugh at serious matters, for it shows disrespect. It is not the Redoran way to spread rumors, for they fester and breed dissention.\nA Redoran must show piety to the Aedra and Daedra, our creators and ancestors. For without the divine, we would not have the chance to serve. And without divine law, we would not know right from wrong. And without giving thanks for these things, we would forget out place and our purpose.\nGreat House Redoran praises all the skills of war. Not because we believe war is good or honorable in its own right, but because this knowledge is necessary to perform one's duty. House Redoran's warrior fight with a long blade and a shield or with a spear. A noble of House Redoran must also learn to use a bow and must be athletic enough for the long marches to battle. A Redoran wears heavy or medium armor depending on rank and strategy. A noble of House Redoran is expected to know how to repair and maintain his own armor.\nThose who are born to House Redoran have been taught their skill and virtues by kin and clan. Those who seek to enter House Redoran as retainers must satisfy an examiner in the Redoran Council Hall that their skills are suitable for service to House Redoran.\nWhether born to the blood of House Redoran, or adopted into service of House Redoran by oath, those who seek to advance in the ranks of House Redoran must demonstrate their virtues by service and obedience. And only when one has mastered all the skills and virtues can one truly call himself a noble of the Great House Redoran."

Nobody by the addressed name lived at the home, and it is unknown how long the family had owned the strongbox. The letters are believed to have been written during the reign of Jarl Elgryr the Unminded, who ruled Windhelm in the Second Era and about whom few other records are extant.\nMy dearest Thessalonius,\nI hope this letter reaches you, and finds you well. It is getting more difficult to find paper within the city, but I still save the scraps sent by the city's tax agents. I hope you don't mind a household reckoning on the reverse of this.\nWindhelm remains as cold as ever, but nothing compared to the heart of her king. Smoke and revelry rise from the palace daily, while we have little wood or coal to keep the chill off. I fear for the little ones, but they're so brave, having never known any other kind of life. We all speak of you daily, and hope that we may come to see you soon.\nYours,\nReylia\n\nDear Thessalonius,\nYour last message arrived safely, but the promised gold mentioned within did not. When I mentioned this to the courier, she shrugged and turned to the door with no other word. While hearing from you brings joy to us all, I would caution you to not trust that particular woman again.\nThe minds of the city grow numb with cold and silence. We starve, and the unminded one makes no appearance, no speech, nothing to succor his people. His wizard has been seen walking the streets of the city at odd hours, visiting homes. I saw him paint some horrid symbol on one door -- it dripped like blood before vanishing like sand in the wind. The next dawn, nobody who lived there still drew breath. I am a friend to one of the scullery maids who was sent to clean out the house. She described the most horrible things to me and the children, but I will spare you the details.\nThe worst of it is, that was a house that supported the king. If that's what happens to his friends, what will be the fate of the rest of us?\nBut don't let this shift your mind from its important tasks. We all know you work to free us, and pray for your success and swift return.\nLove,\nReylia\n\nThis next letter was scribbled onto a piece of cloth with what appears to be charcoal.\nThess.,\nI hope you didn't actually ... [illegible] ... efforts are important, but our sufferings must remain ... [illegible] ... retaliation can be swift and terrible. If you no longer care for me, at least think of your ... [illegible] .... Love always, R\n\nDear Thessalonius,\nWeeks go by and we have no word from Solitude. I tell the children that you're simply very busy, but it's getting harder to make excuses for you. If you can no longer send money (and I understand, smuggling anything of value into the city has become a fool's errand), at least send word that you still live and work for the freedom of Windhelm.\nAs regards your issue that I mentioned previously, worry not. With food shortages being what they are, I have removed it from my concerns.\nAlways yours,\nReylia\n\nMy dearest Thessalonius,\nIt was good to hear from you at last. Please forgive the rantings of a starving mind. We have at last depleted the basement stores of food, even with the strictest rationing. I see the little ones' faces growing thin and my heart weeps for them. They are, in some ways, brave. I think they're looking after me moreso than I them.\nPlease come home. I strongly desire to look upon your face.\n-- R\n\nPapa,\nMa said to write you, so we love and miss you. Ma is tired a lot, but has lots of visitors, so we are being good and helpping.\nLove,\nStessl and Shapl\n\nThessalonius,\nI don't have much time. The city has finally broken. The gates of the palace will not keep us out. The storming begins soon. I have gathered those who still have a spirit to live, and we are taking our own fortunes to hand. I hope to see you on the other side of this. Pray for us as we once prayed for you.\nYour Reylia"

    "description": "Facts and theories about Wispmothers.",
    "text": "The Wispmother:\nTwo Theories\nby\nMathias Etienne\n\nAmong the folk tales from the northern reaches of Skyrim, few subjects are as popular as the Wispmother: ghostly women who lure unsuspecting travelers to their doom, steal children, and takes vengeance on those who wronged them in life.\nSimilar tales exist throughout Tamriel: The Melusanae of Stros Mkai, who lure ships to wreck on jagged shoals, then consume the souls of those aboard. The serpentine Chalass of Black Marsh. The Amronal of Valenwood.\nBut unlike these mythic creatures, most scholars concede that Wispmothers actually exist. Though rare, credible reports of their sightings are simply too frequent to be ignored. Herein, a synopsis of what can be gleaned from provincial legends, and the dominant theories on what they may actually be.\nWispmothers\nMost tales agree on only a few basic facts about Wispmothers. They are always female. They take the form of human (some say Elven) spirits, wreathed in mist and decaying rags. They have an affinity for frost magic, rarely appearing in more temperate climes.\nBut beyond that, the tales differ wildly. Some say they are ghosts, waiting to be laid to rest. Others, that they are all that remains of the Snow Elves who once ruled Skyrim. Some say they are native to Hjaalmarch (or the north more generally), but other tales mention them in forgotten places, on mountaintops as far away as the Jeralls.\nMost reputable scholars dismiss these stories, preferring instead to focus on the few documented sightings from recent years. From these, two dominant theories have emerged:\nBased on his extensive research into necromancy and Cyrodiil's Ayleid culture, Master Sadren Sarethi posits that Wispmothers are a necrologic state, a type of lich-dom developed by a now-forgotten First Era culture. Under his theory, these are no mere ghosts - they are a cult of powerful sorceresses who achieved eternal life through undeath.\nAlternately, Lydette Viliane of the Synod contends that Wispmothers are not undead at all, but rather elemental manifestations arising out of Nirn itself. By noting several similarities to Spriggans and Ice Wraiths, she contends that the Wispmothers are essentially elemental personifications of snow or mist, innately wielding the power of their element, instead of manipulating it through conventional sorcery.\nWisps\nIn most accounts, the victim is initially drawn to the Wispmother by glowing, ghostly lights. Although initially passive, these creatures later attack in tandem with her, distracting the victim and draining their energy.\nPopular legend holds that these are the spirits of the Wispmother's previous victims. These spirits strengthen her, so anyone hoping to destroy her must first release the souls of those she has killed.\nTo scholars, this description immediately recalls the Will-o-the-Wisp, a rare and dangerous swamp denizen of southern Tamriel. Oddly, Cyrodillic legends invariably refer to Wisps as lone predators, while these appear to exist in some sort of symbiotic relationship with others of their kind.\nViliane argues that these Wisps are a sub-species of true Wisps, scavengers that lure prey to the Wispmother and share in the psychoetherial energy released by her kills. As co-dependent scavengers, they most likely lack the formidable defenses of their predatory cousins, rendering them far more vulnerable.\nAlternately, Sarethi posits that these \"Wisps\" are merely emanations or conjurations of the Wispmother, and not free-living creatures. This is supported by one incident in which an adventurer reportedly killed a Wispmother directly, only to observe the remaining Wisps immediately perish as well, though the source is considered highly unreliable.\nIn summary, scholarly opinion about Wispmothers and Wisps is sharply divided, and is likely to remain so for some time. But all sources agree on one crucial point: these are highly dangerous foes, and should be avoided at all costs.\n"

    "text": "The Wolf Queen, v1\nTHE WOLF QUEEN\nBook One\nby\nWaughin Jarth\n\nFrom the pen of the first century third era sage Montocai:\n3E 63:\nIn the autumntide of the year, Prince Pelagius, son of Prince Uriel, who is son of the Empress Kintyra, who is niece of the great Emperor Tiber Septim, came to the High Rock city-state of Camlorn to pay court to the daughter of King Vulstaed. Her name was Quintilla, the most beauteous princess in Tamriel, skilled at all the maidenly skills and an accomplished sorceress.\nEleven years a widower with a young son named Antiochus, Pelagius arrived at court to find that the city-state was being terrorized by a great demon werewolf. Instead of wooing, Pelagius and Quintilla together went out to save the kingdom. With his sword and her sorcery, the beast was slain and by the powers of mysticism, Quintilla chained the beast's soul to a gem. Pelagius had the gem made into a ring and married her.\nBut it was said that the soul of the wolf stayed with the couple until the birth of their first child.\n3E 80\n\"The ambassador from Solitude has arrived, your majesty,\" whispered the steward Balvus.\n\"Right in the middle of dinner?\" muttered the Emperor weakly. \"Tell him to wait.\"\n\"No, father, it's important that you see him,\" said Pelagius, rising. \"You can't make him wait and then give him bad news. It's undiplomatic.\"\n\"Don't go then, you're much better at diplomacy than I am. We should have all the family here,\" Emperor Uriel II added, suddenly aware how few people were present at his dinner table. \"Where's your mother?\"\n\"Sleeping with the archpriest of Kynareth,\" Pelagius would have said, but he was, as his father said, diplomatic. Instead he said, \"At prayer.\"\n\"And your brother and sister?\"\n\"Amiel is in Firsthold, meeting with the Archmagister of the Mages Guild. And Galana, though we won't be telling this to the ambassador, of course, is preparing for her wedding to the Duke of Narsis. Since the ambassador expects her to be marrying his patron the King of Solitude instead, we'll tell him that she's at the spa, having a cluster of pestilent boils removed. Tell him that, and he won't press too hard for the marriage, politically expedient though it may be,\" Pelagius smiled. \"You know how queasy Nords are about warty women.\"\n\"But dash it, I feel like I should have some family around, so I don't look like some old fool despised by his nearest and dearest,\" growled the Emperor, correctly suspecting this to be the case. \"What about your wife? Where's she and the grandchildren?\"\n\"Quintilla's in the nursery with Cephorus and Magnus. Antiochus is probably whoring around the City. I don't know where Potema is, probably at her studies. I thought you didn't like children around.\"\n\"I do during meetings with ambassadors in damp staterooms,\" sighed the Emperor. \"They lend an air of, I don't know, innocence and civility. Ah, show the blasted ambassador in,\" he said to Balvus.\nPotema was bored. It was the rainy season in the Imperial Province, wintertide, and the streets and the gardens of the City were all flooded. She could not remember a time when it was not raining. Had it been only days, or had it been weeks or months since the sun shone? There was no judging of time any more in the constant flickering torch-light of the palace, and as Potema walked through marble and stone hallways, listening to the pelting of the rain, she could think nothing but that she was bored.\nAsthephe, her tutor, would be looking for her now. Ordinarily, she did not mind studying. Rote memorization came easily to her. She quizzed herself as she walked down through the empty ballroom. When did Orsinium fall? 1E 980. Who wrote Tamrilean Tractates? Khosey. When was Tiber Septim born? 2E 288. Who is the current King of Daggerfall? Mortyn, son of Gothlyr. Who is the current Silvenar? Varbarenth, son of Varbaril. Who is the Warlord of Lilmoth? Trick question: it's a lady, Ioa.\nWhat will I get if I'm a good girl, and don't get into any trouble, and my tutor says I'm an excellent student? Mother and father will renege on their promise to buy me a daedric katana of my own, saying they never remembered that promise, and it's far too expensive and dangerous for a girl my age.\nThere were voices coming from the Emperor's stateroom. Her father, her grandfather, and a man with a strange accent, a Nord. Potema moved a stone she had loosened behind a tapestry and listened in.\n\"Let us be frank, your imperial majesty,\" came the Nord's voice. \"My sire, the King of Solitude, doesn't care if Princess Galana looked like an orc. He wants an alliance with the Imperial family, and you agreed to give him Galana or give back the millions of gold he gave to you to quell the Khajiiti rebellion in Torval. This was the agreement you swore to honor.\"\n\"I remember no such agreement,\" came her father's voice, \"Can you, my liege?\"\nThere was a mumbling noise that Potema took to be her grandfather, the ancient Emperor.\n\"Perhaps we should take a walk to the Hall of Records, my mind may be going,\" the Nord's voice sounded sarcastic. \"I distinctly remember your seal being placed on the agreement before it was locked away. Of course, I may verily be mistaken.\"\n\"We will send a page to the Hall to get the document you refer to,\" replied her father's voice, with the cruel, soothing quality he used whenever he was about to break a promise. Potema knew it well. She replaced the loose stone and hurried out of the ballroom. She knew well how slowly the pages walked, used to running errands for a doddering emperor. She could make it to the Hall of Records in no time at all.\nThe massive ebony door was locked, of course, but she knew what to do. A year ago, she caught her mother's Bosmer maid pilfering some jewelry, and in exchange for her silence, forced the young woman to teach her how to pick locks. Potema pulled two pins off her red diamond broach and slid the first into the first lock, holding her hand steady, and memorizing the pattern of tumblers and grooves within the mechanism.\nEach lock had a geography of its own.\nThe lock to the kitchen larder: six free tumblers, a frozen seventh, and a counter bolt. She had broken into that just for fun, but if she had been a poisoner, the whole Imperial household would be dead by now, she thought, smiling.\nThe lock to her brother Antiochus' secret stash of Khajiiti pornography: just two free tumblers and a pathetic poisoned quill trap easily dismantled with pressure on the counterweight. That had been a profitable score. It was strange that Antiochus, who seemed to have no shame, proved so easy to blackmail. She was, after all, only twelve, and the differences between the perversions of the cat people and the perversions of the Cyrodiils seemed pretty academic. Still, Antiochus had to give her the diamond broach, which she treasured.\nShe had never been caught. Not when she broke into the archmage's study and stole his oldest spellbook. Not when she broke into the guest room of the King of Gilane, and stole his crown the morning before Magnus's official Welcoming ceremony. It had become too easy to torment her family with these little crimes. But here was a document the Emperor wanted, for a very important meeting. She would get it first.\nBut this, this was the hardest lock she ever opened. Over and over, she massaged the tumblers, gently pushing aside the forked clamp that snatched at her pins, drumming the counterweights. It nearly took her a half a minute to break through the door to the Hall of Records, where the Elder Scrolls were housed.\nThe documents were well organized by year, province, and kingdom, and it took Potema only a short while to find the Promise of Marriage between Uriel Septim II, by the Grace of the Gods, Emperor of the Holy Cyrodiilic Empire of Tamriel and his daughter the Princess Galana, and His Majesty King Mantiarco of Solitude. She grabbed her prize and was out of the Hall with the door well-locked before the page was even in sight.\nBack in the ball room, she loosened the stone and listened eagerly to the conversation within. For a few minutes, the three men, the Nord, the Emperor, and her father just spoke of the weather and some boring diplomatic details. Then there was the sound of footsteps and a young voice, the page.\n\"Your Imperial Majesty, I have searched the Hall of Records and cannot find the document you asked for.\"\n\"There, you see,\" came Potema's father's voice. \"I told you it didn't exist.\"\n\"But I saw it!\" The Nord's voice was furious. \"I was there when my liege and the emperor signed it! I was there!\"\n\"I hope you aren't doubting the word of my father, the sovereign Emperor of all Tamriel, not when there's now proof that you must have been ... mistaken,\" Pelagius's voice was low, dangerous.\n\"Of course not,\" said the Nord, conceding quickly. \"But what will I tell my king? He is to have no connection with the Imperial family, and no gold returned to him, as the agreement -- as he and I believed the agreement to be?\"\n\"We don't want any bad feelings between the kingdom of Solitude and us,\" came the Emperor's voice, rather feeble, but clear enough. \"What if we offered King Mantiarco our granddaughter instead?\"\nPotema felt the chill of the room descend on her.\n\"The Princess Potema? Is she not too young?\" asked the Nord.\n\"She is thirteen years old,\" said her father. \"That's old enough to wed.\"\n\"She would an ideal mate for your king,\" said the Emperor. \"She is, admittedly, from what I see of her, very shy and innocent, but I'm certain she would quickly grasp the ways of court -- she is, after all, a Septim. I think she would be an excellent Queen of Solitude. Not too exciting, but noble.\"\n\"The granddaughter of the Emperor is not as close as his daughter,\" said the Nord, rather miserably. \"But I don't see how we can refuse the offer. I will send word to my king.\"\n\"You have our leave,\" said the Emperor, and Potema heard the sound of the Nord leaving the stateroom.\nTears streamed down Potema's eyes. She knew who the King of Solitude was from her studies. Mantiarco. Sixty-two years old, and quite fat. And she knew how far Solitude was, and how cold, in the northernmost clime. Her father and grandfather were abandoning her to the barbaric Nords. The voices in the room continued talking.\n\"Well-acted, my boy. Now, make sure you burn that document,\" said her father.\n\"My Prince?\" asked the page's querulous voice.\n\"The agreement between the Emperor and the King of Solitude, you fool. We don't want its existence known.\"\n\"My Prince, I told the truth. I couldn't find the document in the Hall of Records. It seems to be missing.\"\n\"By Lorkhan!\" roared her father. \"Why is everything in this palace always misplaced? Go back to the Hall and keep searching until you find it!\"\nPotema looked at the document. Millions of gold pieces promised to the kingdom of Solitude in the event of Princess Galana not marrying the king. She could bring it into her father, and perhaps as a reward he would not marry her to Mantiarco. Or perhaps not. She could blackmail her father and the Emperor with it, and make a tidy sum of money. Or she could produce it when she became Queen of Solitude to fill her coffers, and buy anything she wanted. More than a daedric katana, that was for certain.\nSo many possibilities, Potema thought. And she found herself not bored anymore.\nThe Wolf Queen, v2\nThe Wolf Queen\nBook Two\nby \nWaughin Jarth\nFrom the pen of the first century third era sage Montocai:\n3E 82:\nA year after the wedding of his 14-year-old granddaughter the Princess Potema to King Mantiarco of the Nordic kingdom of Solitude, the Emperor Uriel Septim II passed on. His son Pelagius Septim II was made emperor, and he faced a greatly depleted treasury, thanks to his father's poor management.\nAs the new Queen of Solitude, Potema faced opposition from the old Nordic houses, who viewed her as an outsider. Mantiarco had been widowed, and his former queen was loved. She had left him a son, Prince Bathorgh, who was two years older than his stepmother, and loved her not. But the king loved his queen, and suffered with her through miscarriage after miscarriage, until her 29th year, when she bore him a son.\n3E 97:\n\"You must do something to help the pain!\" Potema cried, baring her teeth. The healer Kelmeth immediately thought of a she-wolf in labor, but he put the image from his mind. Her enemies called her the Wolf Queen for certes, but not because of any physical resemblance.\n\"Your Majesty, there is no injury for me to heal. The pain you feel is natural and helpful for the birth,\" he was going to add more words of consolation, but he had to break off to duck the mirror she flung at him.\n\"I'm not a pignosed peasant girl!\" She snarled, \"I am the Queen of Solitude, daughter of the Emperor! Summon the daedra! I'll trade the soul of every last subject of mine for a little comfort!\"\n\"My Lady,\" said the healer nervously, drawing the curtains and blotting out the cold morning sun. \"It is not wise to make such offers even in jest. The eyes of Oblivion are forever watching for just such a rash interjection.\"\n\"What would you know of Oblivion, healer?\" she growled, but her voice was calmer, quieter. The pain had relaxed. \"Would you fetch me that mirror I hurled at you?\"\n\"Are you going to throw it again, your Majesty?\" said the healer with a taut smile, obeying her.\n\"Very likely,\" she said, looking at her reflection. \"And next time I won't miss. But I do look a fright. Is Lord Vhokken still waiting for me in the hall?\"\n\"Yes, your Majesty.\"\n\"Well, tell him I just need to fix my hair and I'll be with him. And leave us. I'll howl for you when the pain returns.\"\n\"Yes, your Majesty.\"\nA few minutes later, Lord Vhokken was shown into the chamber. He was an enormous bald man whose friends and enemies called Mount Vhokken, and when he spoke it was with the low grumble of thunder. The Queen was one of the very few people Vhokken knew who was not the least bit intimidated by him, and he offered her a smile.\n\"My queen, how are you feeling?\" he asked.\n\"Damned. But you're looking like Springtide has come to Mount Vhokken. I take it from your merry disposition that you've been made warchief.\"\n\"Only temporarily, while your husband the King investigates whether there is evidence behind the rumors of treason on the part of my predecessor Lord Thone.\"\n\"If you've planted it as I've instructed, he'll find it,\" Potema smiled, propping herself up in the bed. \"Tell me, is Prince Bathorgh still in the city?\"\n\"What a question, your highness,\" laughed the mountain. \"It's the Tournament of Stamina today, you know the prince would never miss that. The fellow invents new strategies of self-defense every year to show off during the games. Don't you recall last year, where he entered the ring unarmored and after twenty minutes of fending off six bladesmen, left the games without a scratch? He dedicated that bout to his late mother, Queen Amodetha.\"\n\"Yes, I recall.\"\n\"He's no friend to me or you, your highness, but you must give the man his due respect. He moves like lightning. You wouldn't think it of him, but he always seems to use his awkwardness to his advantage, to throw his opponents off. Some say he learned the style from the orcs to the south. They say he learned from them how to anticipate a foe's attack by some sort of supernatural power.\"\n\"There's nothing supernatural about it,\" said the Queen, quietly. \"He gets it from his father.\"\n\"Mantiarco never moved like that,\" Vhokken chuckled.\n\"I never said he did,\" said Potema. Her eyes closed and her teeth gritted together. \"The pain's returning. You must fetch the healer, but first, I must ask you one other thing -- has the new summer palace construction begun?\"\n\"I think so, your Highness.\"\n\"Do not think!\" she cried, gripping the sheets, biting her lips so a stream of blood dripped down her chin. \"Do! Make certain that the construction begins at once, today! Your future, my future, and the future of this child depend on it! Go!\"\nFour hours later, King Mantiarco entered the room to see his son. His queen smiled weakly as he gave her a kiss on the forehead. When she handed him the child, a tear ran down his face. Another one quickly followed, and then another.\n\"My Lord,\" she said fondly. \"I know you're sentimental, but really!\"\n\"It's not only the child, though he is beautiful, with all the fair features of his mother,\" Mantiarco turned to his wife, sadly, his aged features twisted in agony. \"My dear wife, there is trouble at the palace. In truth, this birth is the only thing that keeps this day from being the darkest in my reign.\"\n\"What is it? Something at the tournament?\" Potema pulled herself up in bed. \"Something with Bathorgh?\"\n\"No, it's isn't the tournament, but it does relate to Bathorgh. I shouldn't worry you at a time like this. You need your rest.\"\n\"My husband, tell me!\"\n\"I wanted to surprise you with a gift after the birth of our child, so I had the old summer palace completely renovated. It's a beautiful place, or at least it was. I thought you might like it. Truth to tell, it was Lord Vhokken idea. It used to be Amodetha's favorite place.\" Bitterness crept into the king's voice. \"Now I've learned why.\"\n\"What have you learned?\" asked Potema quietly.\n\"Amodetha deceived me there, with my trusted warchief, Lord Thone. There were letters between them, the most perverse things you've ever read. And that's not the worst of it.\"\n\"No?\"\n\"The dates on the letters correspond with the time of Bathorgh's birth. The boy I raised and loved as a son,\" Mantiarco's voice choked up with emotion. \"He was Thone's child, not mine.\"\n\"My darling,\" said Potema, almost feeling sorry for the old man. She wrapped her arms around his neck, as he heaved his sobs down on her and their child.\n\"Henceforth,\" he said quietly. \"Bathorgh is no longer my heir. He will be banished from the kingdom. This child you have borne me today will grow to rule Solitude.\"\n\"And perhaps more,\" said Potema. \"He is the Emperor's grandson as well.\"\n\"We will name him Mantiarco the Second.\"\n\"My darling, I would love that,\" said Potema, kissing the king's tear-streaked face. \"But may I suggest Uriel, after my grandfather the Emperor, who brought us together in marriage?\"\nKing Mantiarco smiled at his wife and nodded his head. There was a knock at the door.\n\"My liege,\" said Mount Vhokken. \"His highness Prince Bathorgh has finished the tournament and awaits you to present his award. He has successfully withstood attacks by nine archers and the giant scorpion we brought in from Hammerfell. The crowd is roaring his name. They are calling him The Man Who Cannot Be Hit.\"\n\"I will see him,\" said King Mantiarco sadly, and left the chamber.\n\"Oh he can be hit, all right,\" said Potema wearily. \"But it does take some doing.\"\nThe Wolf Queen, v3\nThe Wolf Queen\nBook Three\nby \nWaughin Jarth\nFrom the pen of the first century third era sage Montocai:\n3E 98\nThe Emperor Pelagius Septim II died a few weeks before the end of the year, on the 15th of Evening Star during the festival of North Wind's Prayer, which was considered a bad omen for the Empire. He had ruled over a difficult seventeen years. In order to fill the bankrupt treasury, Pelagius had dismissed the Elder Council, forcing them to buy back their positions. Several good but poor councilors had been lost. Many say the Emperor had died as a result of being poisoned by a vengeful former Council member.\nHis children came to attend his funeral and the coronation of the next Emperor. His youngest son Prince Magnus, 19 years of age, arrived from Almalexia, where he had been a councilor to the royal court. 21-year-old Prince Cephorus arrived from Gilane with his Redguard bride, Queen Bianki. Prince Antiochus at 43 years of age, the eldest child and heir presumptive, had been with his father in the Imperial City. The last to appear was his only daughter, Potema, the so-called Wolf Queen of Solitude. Thirty years old and radiantly beautiful, she arrived with a magnificent entourage, accompanied by her husband, the elderly King Mantiarco and her year-old son, Uriel.\nAll expected Antiochus to assume the throne of the Empire, but no one knew what to expect from the Wolf Queen.\n3E 99\n\"Lord Vhokken has been bringing several men to your sister's chambers late at night every night this week,\" offered the Spymaster. \"Perhaps if her husband were made aware --\"\n\"My sister is a devotee of the conqueror gods Reman and Talos, not the love goddess Dibella. She is plotting with those men, not having orgies with them. I'd wager I've slept with more men than she has,\" laughed Antiochus, and then grew serious. \"She's behind the delay of the council offering me the crown, I know it. Six weeks now. They say they need to update records and prepare for the coronation. I'm the Emperor! Crown me, and to Oblivion with the formalities!\"\n\"Your sister is surely no friend of yours, your majesty, but there are other factors at play. Do not forget how your father treated the Council. It is they who need following, and if need be, strong convincing,\" The Spymaster added, with a suggestive stab of his dagger.\n\"Do so, but keep your eye on the damnable Wolf Queen as well. You know where to find me.\"\n\"At which brothel, your highness?\" inquired the Spymaster.\n\"Today being Fredas, I'll be at the Cat and Goblin.\"\nThe Spymaster noted in his report that night that Queen Potema had no visitors, for she was dining across the Imperial Garden at the Blue Palace with her mother, the Dowager Empress Quintilla. It was a warm night for wintertide and surprisingly cloudless though the day had been stormy. The saturated ground could not take any more, so the formal, structured gardens looked as if they had been glazed with water. The two women took their wine to the wide balcony to look over the grounds.\n\"I believe you are trying to sabotage your half-brother's coronation,\" said Quintilla, not looking at her daughter. Potema saw how the years had not so much wrinkled her mother as faded her, like the sun on a stone.\n\"It's not true,\" said Potema. \"But would it bother you very much if it were true?\"\n\"Antiochus is not my son. He was eleven years old when I married your father, and we've never been close. I think that being heir presumptive has stunted his growth. He is old enough to have a family with grown children, and yet he spends all his time at debauchery and fornication. He will not make a very good Emperor,\" Quintilla sighed and then turned to Potema. \"But it is bad for the family for seeds of discontent to be sown. It is easy to divide up into factions, but very difficult to unite again. I fear for the future of the Empire.\"\n\"Those sound like the words -- are you, by any chance, dying, mother?\"\n\"I've read the omens,\" said Quintilla with a faint, ironic smile. \"Don't forget -- I was a renowned sorceress in Camlorn. I will dead in a few months time, and then, not a year later, your husband will die. I only regret that I will not live to see your child Uriel assume the throne of Solitude.\"\n\"Have you seen whether --\" Potema stopped, not wanting to reveal too many of her plans, even to a dying woman.\n\"Whether he will be Emperor? Aye, I know the answer to that too, daughter. Don't fear: you'll live to see the answer, one way or the other. I have a gift for him when he is of age,\" The Dowager Empress removed a necklace with a single great yellow gem from around her neck. \"It's a soul gem, infused with the spirit of a great werewolf your father and I defeated in battle thirty-six years ago. I've enchanted it with spells from the School of Illusion so its wearer may charm whoever he choses. An important skill for a king.\"\n\"And an emperor,\" said Potema, taking the necklace. \"Thank you, mother.\"\nAn hour later, passing the black branches of the sculpted douad shrubs, Potema noticed a dark figure, which vanished into the shadows under the eaves at her approach. She had noticed people following her before: it was one of the hazards of life in the Imperial court. But this man was too close to her chambers. She slipped the necklace around her neck.\n\"Come out where I can see you,\" she commanded.\nThe man emerged from the shadows. A dark little fellow of middle-age dressed in black-dyed goatskin. His eyes were fixed, frozen, under her spell.\n\"Who do you work for?\"\n\"Prince Antiochus is my master,\" he said in a dead voice. \"I am his spy.\"\nA plan formed. \"Is the Prince in his study?\"\n\"No, milady.\"\n\"And you have access?\"\n\"Yes, milady.\"\nPotema smiled widely. She had him. \"Lead the way.\"\nThe next morning, the storm reappeared in all its fury. The pelting on the walls and ceiling was agony to Antiochus, who was discovering that he no longer had his youthful immunity to a late night of hard drinking. He shoved hard against the Argonian wench sharing his bed.\n\"Make yourself useful and close the window,\" he moaned.\nNo sooner had the window been bolted then there was a knock at the door. It was the Spymaster. He smiled at the Prince and handed him a sheet of paper.\n\"What is this?\" said Antiochus, squinting his eyes. \"I must still be drunk. It looks like orcish.\"\n\"I think you will find it useful, your majesty. Your sister is here to see you.\"\nAntiochus considered getting dressed or sending his bedmate out, but thought better of it. \"Show her in. Let her be scandalized.\"\nIf Potema was scandalized, she did not show it. Swathed in orange and silver silk, she entered the room with a triumphant smile, followed by the man-mountain Lord Vhokken.\n\"Dear brother, I spoke to my mother last night, and she advised me very wisely. She said I should not battle with you in public, for the good of our family and the Empire. Therefore,\" she said, producing from the folds of her robe a piece of paper. \"I am offering you a choice.\"\n\"A choice?\" said Antiochus, returning her smile. \"That does sound friendly.\"\n\"Abdicate your rights to the Imperial throne voluntarily, and there is no need for me to show the Council this,\" Potema said, handing her brother the letter. \"It is a letter with your seal on it, saying that you knew that your father was not Pelagius Septim II, but the royal steward Fondoukth. Now, before you deny writing the letter, you cannot deny the rumors, nor that the Imperial Council will believe that your father, the old fool, was quite capable of being cuckolded. Whether it's true or not, or whether the letter is a forgery or not, the scandal of it would ruin your chances of being the Emperor.\"\nAntiochus's face had gone white with fury.\n\"Don't fear, brother,\" said Potema, taking back the letter from his shaking hands. \"I will see to it that you have a very comfortable life, and all the whores your heart, or any other organ, desires.\"\nSuddenly Antiochus laughed. He looked over at his Spymaster and winked. \"I remember when you broke into my stash of Khajiiti erotica and blackmailed me. That was close to twenty years ago. We've got better locks now, you must have noticed. It must have killed you that you couldn't use your own skills to get what you wanted.\"\nPotema merely smiled. It didn't matter. She had him.\n\"You must have charmed my servant here into getting you into my study to use my seal,\" Antiochus smirked. \"A spell, perhaps, from your mother, the witch?\"\nPotema continued to smile. Her brother was cleverer than she thought.\n\"Did you know that Charm spells, even powerful ones, only last so long?  Of course, you didn't. You never were one for magic. Let me tell you, a generous salary is a stronger motivation for keeping a servant in the long run, sister,\" Antiochus took out his own sheet of paper. \"Now I have a choice for you.\"\n\"What is that?\" said Potema, her smile faltering.\n\"It looks like nonsense, but if you know what you're looking for, it's very clear. It's a practice sheet -- your handwriting attempting to look like my handwriting. It's a good gift you have. I wonder if you haven't done this before, imitating another person's handwriting. I understand a letter was found from your husband's dead wife saying that his first son was a bastard. I wonder if you wrote that letter. I wonder if I showed this evidence of your gift to your husband whether he would believe you wrote that letter. In the future, dear Wolf Queen, don't lay the same trap twice.\"\nPotema shook her head, furious, unable to speak.\n\"Give me your forgery and go take a walk in the rain. And then, later today, unhatch whatever other plots you have to keep me from the throne.\" Antiochus fixed his eyes on Potema's. \"I will be Emperor, Wolf Queen. Now go.\"\nPotema handed her brother the letter and left the room. For a few moments, out in the hallway, she said nothing. She merely glared at the slivers of rainwater dripping down the marble wall from a tiny, unseen crack.\n\"Yes, you will, brother,\" she said. \"But not for very long.\"\nThe Wolf Queen, v4\nThe Wolf Queen\nBook Four\nby \nWaughin Jarth\nFrom the pen of the first century third era sage Montocai:\n3E 109:\nTen years after being crowned Emperor of Tamriel, Antiochus Septim had impressed his subjects with little but the enormity of his lust for carnal pleasures. By his second wife, Gysilla, he had a daughter in the year 104, who he named Kintyra, after his great-great-great grandaunt, the Empress. Enormously fat and marked by every venereal disease known to the Healers, Antiochus spent little time on politics. His siblings, by marked contrast, excelled in this field. Magnus had married Hellena, the Cyrodiil Queen of Lilmoth -- the Argonian priest-king having been executed -- and was representing the Imperial interests in Black Marsh admirably. Cephorus and his wife Bianki were ruling the Hammerfell kingdom of Gilane with a healthy brood of children. But no one was more politically active than Potema, the Wolf-Queen of the Skyrim kingdom of Solitude.\nNine years after the death of her husband, King Mantiarco, Potema still ruled as regent for her young son, Uriel. Their court had become very fashionable, particularly for rulers who had a grudge to bear against the Emperor. All the kings of Skyrim visited Castle Solitude regularly, and over the years, emissaries from the lands of Morrowind and High Rock did as well. Some guests came from even farther away.\n3E 110:\nPotema stood at the harbor and watched the boat from Pyandonea arrive. Against the gray, breaking waves where she had seen so many vessels of Tamrielic manufacture, it looked less than exotic. Insectoid, certainly, with its membranous sails and rugged chitin hull, but she had seen similar if not identical seacraft in Morrowind. No, if not for the flag which was markedly alien, she would not have picked out the ship from others in the harbor. As the salty mist ballooned around her, she held out her hand in welcome to the visitors from another island empire.\nThe men aboard were not merely pale, they were entirely colorless, as if their flesh were made of some white limpid jelly, but she had been forewarned. At the arrival of the King and his translator, she looked directly into their blank eyes and offered her hand. The King made noises.\n\"His Great Majesty, King Orgnum,\" said the translator, haltingly. \"Expresses his delight at your beauty. He thanks you for giving him refuge from these dangerous seas.\"\n\"You speak Cyrodilic very well,\" said Potema.\n\"I am fluent in the languages of four continents,\" said the translator. \"I can speak to the denizens of my own country Pyandonea, as well as those of Atmora, Akavir, and here, in Tamriel. Yours is the easiest, actually. I was looking forward to this voyage.\"\n\"Please tell his highness that he is welcome here, and that I am entirely at his disposal,\" said Potema, smiling. Then she added, \"You understand the context? That I am just being polite?\"\n\"Of course,\" said the translator, and then made several noises at the King, which the King reacted to with a smile. While they conversed, Potema looked up the dock and saw the now familiar gray cloaks watching her while they spoke with Levlet, Antiochus's man. The Psijic Order from the Summerset Isle. Very bothersome.\n\"My diplomatic emissary Lord Vhokken will show you to your rooms,\" said Potema. \"Unfortunately, I have some other guests as well who require my attention. I hope your great majesty understands.\"\nHis Great Majesty King Orgnum did understand, and Potema made arrangements to dine with the Pyandoneans that evening. Meeting with the Psijic Order required all of her concentration. She dressed in her simplest black and gold robe and went to her stateroom to prepare. Her son, Uriel, was on the throne, playing with his pet joughat.\n\"Good morning, mom.\"\n\"Good morning, darling,\" said Potema, lifting her son in the air with feigned stain. \"Talos, but you're heavy. I don't think I've ever carried such a heavy ten-year-old.\"\n\"That's probably because I'm eleven,\" said Uriel, perfectly aware of his mother's tricks. \"And you're going to say that as an eleven-year-old, I should probably be with my tutor.\"\n\"I was fanatical about studying at your age,\" said Potema.\n\"I am king,\" said Uriel petulantly.\n\"But don't be satisfied with that,\" said Potema. \"By all rights, you should be emperor already, you understand that, don't you?\"\nUriel nodded his head. Potema took a moment to marvel at his likeness to the portraits of Tiber Septim. The same ruthless brow and powerful chin. When he was older and lost his baby fat, he'd be a splitting image of his great great great great great granduncle. Behind her, she heard the door opening and an usher bringing in several gray cloaks. She stiffened slightly, and Uriel, on cue, jumped down from the throne and left the stateroom, pausing to greet the most important of the Psijics.\n\"Good Morning, Master Iachesis,\" he said, enunciating each syllable with a regal accent that made Potema's heart soar. \"I hope your accommodations at Castle Solitude meet with your approval.\"\n\"They do, King Uriel, thank you,\" said Iachesis, delighted and charmed.\nIachesis and his Psijics entered the chamber and the door was shut behind them. Potema sat only for a moment on the throne before stepping off the dais and greeting her guests.\n\"I am so sorry to have kept you waiting,\" said Potema. \"To think that you sailed all the way from the Summerset Isles and I should keep you waiting any longer. You must forgive me.\"\n\"It's not all that long a voyage,\" said one of the gray cloaks, angrily. \"It isn't as if we sailed all the way from Pyandonea.\"\n\"Ah. You've seen my most recent guests, King Orgnum and his retinue,\" said Potema breezily. \"I suppose you think it unusual, me entertaining them, as we all know the Pyandoneans mean to invade Tamriel. You are, I take it, as neutral in this as you are in all political matters?\"\n\"Of course,\" said Iachesis proudly. \"We have nothing to gain or lose by the invasion. The Psijic Order preceded the organization of Tamriel under the Septim Dynasty and we shall survive under any political regime.\"\n\"Rather like a flea on whatever mongrel happens along, are you?\" said Potema, narrowing her eyes. \"Don't overestimate your importance, Iachesis. Your order's child, the Mages Guild, has twice the power you have, and they are entirely on my side. We are in the process of making an agreement with King Orgnum. When the Pyandoneans take over and I am in my proper place as Empress of this continent, then you shall know your proper place in the order of things.\"\nWith a majestic stride, Potema left the stateroom, leaving the grey cloaks to look from one to the other.\n\"We must speak to Lord Levlet,\" said one of the grey cloaks.\n\"Yes,\" said Iachesis. \"Perhaps we should.\"\nLevlet was quickly found at his usual place at the Moon and Nausea tavern. As the three grey cloaks entered, led by Iachesis, the smoke and the noise seemed to die in their path. Even the smell of tobacco and flin dissipated in their wake. He rose and then escorted them to a small room upstairs.\n\"You've reconsidered,\" said Levlet with a broad smile.\n\"Your Emperor,\" said Iachesis, and then corrected himself, \"Our Emperor originally asked for our support in defending the west coast of Tamriel from the Pyandonean fleet in return for twelve million gold pieces. We offered our services at fifty. Upon reflection on the dangers that a Pyandonean invasion would have, we accept his earlier offer.\"\n\"The Mages Guild has generously -- \"\n\"Perhaps for as low ten million gold pieces,\" said Iachesis quickly.\nOver the course of dinner, Potema promised King Orgnum through the interpreter, to lead an insurrection against her brother. She was delighted to discover that her capacity for lying worked in many different cultures. Potema shared her bed that night with King Orgnum, as it seemed the polite and diplomatic thing to do. As it turned out, he was one of the better lovers she had ever had. He gave her some herbs before beginning that made her feel as if she was floating on the surface of time, conscious only of the gestures of love after she had found herself making them. She felt herself like the cooling mist, quenching the fire of his lust over and over and over again. In the morning, when he kissed her on the cheek, and said with his bald white eyes that he was leaving her, she felt a stab of regret.\nThe ship left harbor that morning, en route to the Summerset Isles and the imminent invasions. She waved them off to sea as she footsteps behind her. It was Levlet.\n\"They will do it for eight million, your highness\" he said.\n\"Thank Mara,\" said Potema. \"I need more time for an insurrection.  Pay them from my treasury, and then go to the Imperial City and get the twelve million from Antiochus. We should make a good profit from this game, and you, of course, will have your share.\"\nThree months later, Potema heard that the fleet of the Pyandoneans had been utterly destroyed by a storm that had appeared suddenly off the Isle of Artaeum. The home port of the Psijic Order. King Orgnum and all of his ships had been utterly annihilated.\n\"Sometimes making people hate you,\" she said, holding her son Uriel close, \"Is how you make a profit .\"\nThe Wolf Queen, v5\nThe Wolf Queen\nBook Five\nby \nWaughin Jarth\nFrom the pen of Inzolicus, Second Century Sage and Student of Montocai:\n3E 119:\nFor twenty-one years, The Emperor Antiochus Septim ruled Tamriel, and proved an able leader despite his moral laxity. His greatest victory was in the War of the Isle in the year 110, when the Imperial fleet and the royal navies of Summerset Isle, together with the magical powers of the Psijic Order, succeeded in destroying the Pyandonean invading armada. His siblings, King Magnus of Lilmoth, King Cephorus of Gilane, and Potema, the Wolf Queen of Solitude, ruled well and relations between the Empire and the kingdoms of Tamriel were much improved. Still, centuries of neglect had not repaired all the scars that existed between the Empire and the kings of High Rock and Skyrim.\nDuring a rare visitation from his sister and nephew Uriel, Antiochus, who had suffered from several illnesses over his reign, lapsed into a coma. For months, he lingered in between life and death while the Elder Council prepared for the ascension of his fifteen-year-old daughter Kintyra to the throne.\n3E 120:\n\"Mother, I can't marry Kintyra,\" said Uriel, more amused by the suggestion than offended. \"She's my first cousin. And besides, I believe she's engaged to one of the lords of council, Modellus.\"\n\"You're so squeamish. There's a time and a place for propriety,\" said Potema. \"But you're correct at any rate about Modellus, and we shouldn't offend the Elder Council at this critical juncture. How do you feel about Princess Rakma? You spent a good deal of time in her company in Farrun.\"\n\"She's all right,\" said Uriel. \"Don't tell me you want to hear all the dirty details.\"\n\"Please spare me your study of her anatomy,\" Potema grimaced. \"But would you marry her?\"\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\"Very good. I'll make the arrangements then,\" Potema made a note for herself before continuing. \"King Lleromo has been a difficult ally to keep, and a political marriage should keep Farrun on our side. Should we need them. When is the funeral?\"\n\"What funeral?\" asked Uriel. \"You mean for Uncle Antiochus?\"\n\"Of course,\" sighed Potema. \"Anyone else of note die recently?\"\n\"There were a bunch of little Redguard children running through the halls, so I guess Cephorus has arrived. Magnus arrived at court yesterday, so it ought to be any day now.\"\n\"It's time to address the Council then,\" said Potema, smiling.\nShe dressed in black, not her usual colorful ensembles. It was important to look the part of the grieving sister. Regarding herself in the mirror, she felt that she looked all of her fifty-three years. A shock of silver wound its way through her auburn hair. The long, cold, dry winters in northern Skyrim had created a map of wrinkles, thin as a spiderweb, all across her face. Still, she knew that when she smiled, she could win hearts, and when she frowned, she could inspire fear. It was enough for her purposes.\nPotema's speech to the Elder Council is perhaps helpful to students of public speaking.\nShe began with flattery and self-abasement: \"My most august and wise friends, members of the Elder Council, I am but a provincial queen, and I can only assume to bring to issue what you yourselves must have already pondered.\"\nShe continued on to praise the late Emperor, who had been a popular ruler, despite his flaws: \"He was a true Septim and a great warrior, destroying -- with your counsel -- the near invincible armada of Pyandonea.\"\nBut little time was wasted, before she came to her point: \"The Empress Gysilla unfortunately did nothing to temper my brother's lustful spirits. In point of fact, no whore in the slums of the city spread out on more beds than she. Had she attended to her duties in the Imperial bedchamber more faithfully, we would have a true heir to the Empire, not the halfwit, milksop bastards who call themselves the Emperor's children. The girl called Kintyra is popularly believed to be the daughter of Gysilla and the Captain of the Guard. It may be that she is the daughter of Gysilla and the boy who cleans the cistern. We can never know for certain. Not as certainly as we can know the lineage of my son, Uriel. The eldest true son of the Septim Dynasty. My lords, the princes of the Empire will not stand for a bastard on the throne, that I can assure you.\"\nShe ended mildly, but with a call to action: \"Posterity will judge you. You know what must be done.\"\nThat evening, Potema entertained her brothers and their wives in the Map Room, her favorite of the Imperial dining chambers. The walls were splashed with bright, if fading representations of the Empire and all the known lands beyond, Atmora, Yokunda, Akavir, Pyandonea, Thras. Overhead the great glass domed ceiling, wet with rain, displayed distorted images of the stars overhead. Lightning flashed every other minute, casting strange phantom shadows on the walls.\n\"When will you speak to the Council?\" asked Potema as dinner was served.\n\"I don't know if I will,\" said Magnus. \"I don't believe I have anything to say.\"\n\"I'll speak to them when they announce the coronation of Kintyra,\" said Cephorus. \"Merely as a formality to show my support and the support of Hammerfell.\"\n\"You can speak for all of Hammerfell?\" asked Potema, with a teasing smile. \"The Redguards must love you very much.\"\n\"We have a unique relationship with the Empire in Hammerfell,\" said Cephorus's wife, Bianki. \"Since the treaty of Stros M'kai, it's been understood that we are part of the Empire, but not a subject.\"\n\"I understand you've already spoken to the Council,\" said Magnus's wife, Hellena, pointedly. She was a diplomat by nature, but as the Cyrodilic ruler of an Argonian kingdom, she knew how to recognize and confront adversity.\n\"Yes, I have,\" said Potema, pausing to savor a slice of braised jalfbird. \"I gave them a short speech about the coronation this afternoon.\"\n\"Our sister is an excellent public speaker,\" said Cephorus.\n\"You're too kind,\" said Potema, laughing. \"I do many things better than speaking.\"\n\"Such as?\" asked Bianki, smiling.\n\"Might I ask what you said in your speech?\" asked Magnus, suspiciously.\nThere was a knock on the chamber door. The head steward whispered something to Potema, who smiled in response and rose from the table.\n\"I told the Council that I would give my full support to the coronation, provided they proceed with wisdom. What could be sinister about that?\" Potema said, and took her glass of wine with her to the door. \"If you'll pardon me, my niece Kintyra wishes to have a word with me.\"\nKintyra stood in the hall with the Imperial Guard. She was but a child, but on reflection, Potema realized that at her age, she was already married two years to Mantiarco. There was a similarity, to be certain. Potema could see Kintyra as the young queen, with dark eyes and pallid skin smooth and resolute like marble. Anger flashed momentarily in Kintyra's eyes on seeing her aunt, but emotion left her, replaced with calm Imperial presence.\n\"Queen Potema,\" she said serenely. \"I have been informed that my coronation will take place in two days time. Your presence at the ceremony will not be welcome. I have already given orders to your servants to have your belongings packed, and an escort will be accompanying you back to your kingdom tonight. That is all. Goodbye, aunt.\"\nPotema began to reply, but Kintyra and her guard turned and moved back down the corridor to the stateroom. The Wolf Queen watched them go, and then reentered the Map Room.\n\"Sister-in-Law,\" said Potema, addressing Bianki with deep malevolence. \"You asked what I do better than speaking? The answer is: war.\"\nThe Wolf Queen, v6\nThe Wolf Queen\nBook Six\n\nby\nWaughin Jarth\nFrom the pen of Inzolicus, Second Century Sage:\n3E 120:\nThe fifteen-year-old Empress Kintyra Septim II, daughter of Antiochus, was coroneted on the 3rd day of First Seed. Her uncles Magnus, King of Lilmoth, and Cephorus, King of Gilane, were in attendance, but her aunt, Potema, the Wolf Queen of Solitude, had been banished from the court. Once back in her kingdom, Queen Potema began assembling the rebellion, which was to be known as the War of the Red Diamond. All the allies she had made over the years of disgruntled kings and nobles joined forces with her against the new Empress.\nThe first early strikes against the Empire were entirely successful. Throughout Skyrim and northern High Rock, the Imperial army found themselves under attack. Potema and her forces washed over Tamriel like a plague, inciting riots and insurrections everywhere they touched. In the autumn of the year, the loyal Duke of Glenpoint on the coast of High Rock sent an urgent request for reinforcements from the Imperial Army, and Kintyra, to inspire the resistance to the Wolf Queen, led the army herself.\n3E 121:\n\"We don't know where they are,\" said the Duke, deeply embarrassed. \"I've sent scouts out all over the countryside. I can only assume that they've retreated up north upon hearing of your army's arrival.\"\n\"I hate to say it, but I was hoping for a battle,\" said Kintyra. \"I'd like to put my aunt's head on a spike and parade it around the Empire. Her son Uriel and his army are right on the border to the Imperial Province, mocking me. How are they able to be so successful? Are they just that good in battle or do my subjects truly hate me?\"\nShe was tired after many months of struggling through the mud of autumn and winter. Crossing the Dragontail Mountains, her army nearly marched into an ambush. A blizzard snap in the normally temperate Barony of Dwynnen was so unexpected and severe that it must certainly have been cast by one of Potema's wizard allies. Everywhere she turned, she felt her aunt's touch. And now, her chance of facing the Wolf Queen at last had been thwarted. It was almost too much to bear.\n\"It is fear, pure and simple,\" said the Duke. \"That is her greatest weapon.\"\n\"I need to ask,\" said Kintyra, hoping that by sheer will she could keep her voice from revealing any of the fear the Duke spoke of. \"You've seen the army. Is it true that she has summoned a force of undead warriors to do her bidding?\"\n\"No, as a matter of fact, it's not true, but she certainly fosters that rumor. Her army attacks at night, partly for strategic reasons, and partly to advance fears like that. She has, so far as I know, no supernatural aid other than the standard battlemages and nightblades of any modern army.\"\n\"Always at night,\" said Kintyra thoughtfully. \"I suppose that's to disguise their numbers.\"\n\"And to move her troops into position before we're aware of them\" added the Duke. \"She's the master of the sneak attack. When you hear a march to the east, you can be certain she's already on top of you from the south. But listen, we'll discuss this all tomorrow morning. I've prepared the castle's best rooms for you and your men.\"\nKintyra sat in her tower suite and by the light of the moon and a single tallow candle, she penned a letter to her husband-to-be, Lord Modellus, back in the Imperial City. She hoped to be married to him in the summer at the Blue Palace her grandmother Quintilla had loved so much, but the war may not permit it. As she wrote, she gazed out the window at the courtyard below and the haunted, leafless trees of winter. Two of her guards stood on the battlements, several feet away from one another. Just like Modellus and Kintyra, she thought, and proceeded to expound on the metaphor in her letter.\nA knock on the door interrupted her poetry.\n\"A letter, your majesty, from Lord Modellus,\" said the young courier, handing the note to her.\nIt was short, and she read it quickly before the courier had a chance to retire. \"I'm confused by something. When did he write this?\"\n\"One week ago,\" said the courier. \"He said it was urgent that I make it here as quickly as possible while he mobilized the army. I imagine they've left the City already.\"\nKintyra dismissed the courier. Modellus said that he had received a letter from her, urgently calling for reinforcements to the battle at Glenpoint. But there was no battle at Glenpoint, and she had only just arrived today. Then who wrote the letter in her handwriting, and why would they want Modellus to bring a second army out of the Imperial City into High Rock?\nFeeling a chill from the night air at the window, Kintyra went to shut the latch. The two guards on the battlements were gone. She leaned over at the sound of a muffled struggle behind one of the barren trees, and did not hear the door open.\nWhen she turned, she saw Queen Potema and Mentin, Duke of Glenpoint, in the room with a host of guards.\n\"You move quietly, aunt,\" she said after a moment's pause. She turned to the Duke. \"What turned you against your loyalty to the Empire? Fear?\"\n\"And gold,\" said the Duke simply.\n\"What happened to my army?\" asked Kintyra, trying to look Potema steadily in the face. \"Is the battle over so soon?\"\n\"All your men are dead,\" smiled Potema. \"But there was no battle here. Merely quiet and efficient assassination. There will be battles ahead, against Modellus in the Dragontail Mountains and against the remnants of the Imperial Army in the City. I'll send you regular updates on the progress of the war.\"\n\"So I am to be kept here as your hostage?\" asked Kintyra, flatly, suddenly aware of the solidity of the stones and the great height of her tower room. \"Damn you, look at me! I am your Empress!\"\n\"Think of it this way, I'm taking you from being a fifth rate ruler to a first rate martyr,\" said Potema with a wink. \"But I understand if you don't want to thank me for that.\"\nThe Wolf Queen, v7\nThe Wolf Queen\nBook Seven\nby \nWaughin Jarth\nFrom the pen of Inzolicus, Second Century Sage:\n3E 125:\nThe exact date of the Empress Kintyra Septim II's execution in the tower at Glenpoint Castle is open to some speculation. Some believe she was slain shortly after her imprisonment in the 121st year, while others maintain that she was likely kept alive as a hostage until shortly before her uncle Cephorus, King of Gilane, reconquered western High Rock in the summer of the 125th year. The certainty of Kintyra's demise rallied many against the Wolf Queen Potema and her son, who had been crowned Emperor Uriel Septim III four years previously when he invaded the under-guarded Imperial City.\nCephorus concentrated his army on the war in High Rock, while his brother Magnus, King of Lilmoth, brought his Argonian troops through loyal Morrowind and into Skyrim to fight in Potema's home province. The reptilian troops fought well in the summer months, but during the winter, they retired south to regroup and attack again when the weather was warm. At this stalemate, the War lasted out two more years.\nAlso, in the 125th year, Magnus's wife Hellena gave birth to their first child, a boy who they named Pelagius, after the Emperor who fathered Magnus, Cephorus, the late Emperor Antiochus, and the dread Wolf Queen of Solitude.\n3E 127:\nPotema sat on soft silk cushions in the warm grass in front of her tent and watched the sun rise over the dark woods on the other side of the meadow. It was a peculiarly vibrant morning, typical of Skyrim summertide. The high chirrup of insects buzzed all around her and the sky surged with thousands of fallowing birds, rolling over one another and forming a multitude of patterns. Nature was unaware of the war coming to Falconstar, she surmised.\n\"Your highness, a message from the army in Hammerfell,\" said one of her maids, bringing in a courier. He was breathing hard, stained with sweat and mud. Evidence of a long, fast ride over many, many miles.\n\"My queen,\" said the courier, looking to the ground. \"I bring grave news of your son, the Emperor. He met your brother King Cephorus's army in Hammerfell in the countryside of Ichidag and there did battle. You would be proud, for he fought well, but in the end, the Imperial army was defeated and your son, our Emperor, was captured. King Cephorus is bringing him to Gilane.\"\nPotema listened to the news, scowling. \"That clumsy fool,\" she said at last.\nPotema stood up and strolled into camp, where the men were arming themselves, preparing for battle. Long ago, the soldiers understood that their lady did not stand on ceremony, and she would prefer that they work rather than salute her. Lord Vhokken was ahead of her, already meeting with the commander of the battlemages, discussing last minute strategy.\n\"My queen,\" said the courier, who had been following her. \"What are you going to do?\"\n\"I'm going to win this battle with Magnus, despite his superior position holding the ruins of Kogmenthist Castle,\" said Potema. \"And then when I know what Cephorus means to do with the Emperor, I'll respond accordingly. If there's a ransom to be paid, I'll pay it; if there's a prison exchange needed, so be it. Now, please, bath yourself and rest, and try not to get in the way of the war.\"\n\"It's not an ideal scenario,\" said Lord Vhokken when Potema had entered the commander's tent. \"If we attack the castle from the west, we'll be running directly into the fire from their mages and archers. If we come from the east, we'll be going through swamps, and the Argonians do better in that type of environment than we do. A lot better.\"\n\"What about the north and south? Just hills, correct?\"\n\"Very steep hills, your highness,\" said the commander. \"We should post bowmen there, but we'll be too vulnerable putting out the majority of our force.\"\n\"So it's the swamp,\" said Potema, and added, pragmatically. \"Unless we withdraw and wait for them to come out before fighting.\"\n\"If we wait, Cephorus will have his army here from High Rock, and we'll be trapped between the two of them,\" said Lord Vhokken. \"Not a preferable situation.\"\n\"I'll talk to the troops,\" said the commander. \"Try to prepare them for the swamp attack.\"\n\"No,\" said Potema. \"I'll speak to them.\"\nIn full battlegear, the soldiers gathered in the center of camp. They were a motley collection of men and women, Cyrodiils, Nords, Bretons, and Dunmer, youngbloods and old veterans, the sons and daughters of nobles, shopkeepers, serfs, priests, prostitutes, farmers, academics, adventurers. All of them under the banner of the Red Diamond, the symbol of the Imperial Family of Tamriel.\n\"My children,\" Potema said, her voice ringing out, hanging in the still morning mist. \"We have fought in many battles together, over mountaintops and beach heads, through forests and deserts. I have seen great acts of valor from each one of you, which does my heart proud. I have also seen dirty fighting, backstabbing, cruel and wanton feats of savagery, which pleases me equally well. For you are all warriors.\"\nWarming to her theme, Potema walked the line from soldier to soldier, looking each one in the eye: \"War is in your blood, in your brain, in your muscles, in everything you think and everything you do. When this war is over, when the forces are vanquished that seek to deny the throne to the true emperor, Uriel Septim III, you may cease to be warriors. You may choose to return to your lives before the war, to your farms and your cities, and show off your scars and tell tales of the deeds you did this day to your wondering neighbors. But on this day, make no mistake, you are warriors. You are war.\"\nShe could see her words were working. All around her, bloodshot eyes were focusing on the slaughter to come, arms tensing around weapons. She continued in her loudest cry, \"And you will move through the swamplands, like an unstoppable power from the blackest part of Oblivion, and you will rip the scales from the reptilian things in Kogmenthist Castle. You are warriors, and you need not only fight, you must win. You must win!\"\nThe soldiers roared in response, shocking the birds from the trees all around the camp.\nFrom a vantage point on the hills to the south, Potema and Lord Vhokken had excellent views of the battle as it raged. It looked like two swarms of two colors of insect moving back and forth over a clump of dirt which was the castle ruins. Occasionally, a burst of flame or a cloud of acid from one of the mages would flicker over the battle arresting their attention, but hour after hour, the fighting seemed like nothing but chaos.\n\"A rider approaches,\" said Lord Vhokken, breaking the silence.\nThe young Redguard woman was wearing the crest of Gilane, but carried a white flag. Potema allowed her to approach. Like the courier from the morning, the rider was well travel-worn.\n\"Your Highness,\" she said, out of breath. \"I have been sent from your brother, my lord King Cephorus, to bring you dire news. Your son Uriel was captured in Ichidag on the field in battle and from there transported to Gilane.\"\n\"I know all this,\" said Potema scornfully. \"I have couriers of my own. You can tell your master that after I've won this battle, I'll pay whatever ransom or exchange --\"\n\"Your Highness, an angry crowd met the caravan your son was in before it made it to Gilane,\" the rider said quickly, \"Your son is dead. He had been burned to death within his carriage. He is dead.\"\nPotema turned from the young woman and looked down at the battle. Her soldiers were going to win. Magnus's army was in retreat.\n\"One other item of news, your highness,\" said the rider. \"King Cephorus is being proclaimed Emperor.\"\nPotema did not look at the woman. Her army was celebrating their victory.\nThe Wolf Queen, v8\nThe Wolf Queen\nBook Eight\nby\nWaughin Jarth\nFrom the pen of Inzolicus, Second Century Sage:\n3E 127:\nFollowing the Battle of Ichidag, the Emperor Uriel Septim III was captured and, before he was able to be brought to his uncle's castle in the Hammerfell kingdom of Gilane, he met his death at the hands of an angry mob. This uncle, Cephorus, was thereafter proclaimed emperor and rode to the Imperial City. The troops formerly loyal to Emperor Uriel and his mother, the Wolf Queen Potema, pledged themselves to the new Emperor. In return for their support, the nobility of Skyrim, High Rock, Hammerfell, the Summerset Isle, Valenwood, Black Marsh, and Morrowind demanded and received a new level of autonomy and independence from the Empire. The War of the Red Diamond was at an end.\nPotema continued to fight a losing battle, her area of influence dwindling and dwindling until only her kingdom of Solitude remained in her power. She summoned daedra to fight for her, had her necromancers resurrect her fallen enemies as undead warriors, and mounted attack after attack on the forces of her brothers, the Emperor Cephorus Septim I and King Magnus of Lilmoth. Her allies began leaving her as her madness grew, and her only companions were the zombies and skeletons she had amassed over the years. The kingdom of Solitude became a land of death. Stories of the ancient Wolf Queen being waited on by rotting skeletal chambermaids and holding war plans with vampiric generals terrified her subjects.\n3E 137:\nMagnus opened up the small window in his room. For the first time in weeks, he heard the sounds of a city: carts squeaking, horses clopping over the cobblestones, and somewhere a child laughing. He smiled as he returned to his bedside to wash his face and finish dressing. There was a distinctive knock on the door.\n\"Come in, Pel,\" he said.\nPelagius bounded into the room. It was obvious that he had been up for hours. Magnus marveled at his energy, and wondered how much longer battles would last if they were run by twelve-year-old boys.\n\"Did you see outside yet?\" Pelagius asked. \"All the townspeople have come back! There are shops, and a Mages Guild, and down by the harbor, I saw a hundred shops come in from all over the place!\"\n\"They don't have to be afraid anymore. We've taken care of all the zombies and ghosts that used to be their neighbors, and they know it's safe to come back.\"\n\"Is Uncle Cephorus going to turn into a zombie when he dies?\" asked Pelagius.\n\"I wouldn't put that past him,\" laughed Magnus. \"Why do you ask?\"\n\"I heard some people saying that he was old and sick,\" said Pelagius.\n\"He's not that old,\" said Magnus. \"He's sixty years old. That's just two years older than I.\"\n\"And how old is Aunt Potema?\" asked Pelagius.\n\"Seventy,\" said Magnus. \"And yes, that is old. Any more questions will have to wait. I have to go meet with the commander now, but we can talk at supper. You can make yourself busy, and not get into any trouble?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Pelagius. He understood that his father had to continue to hold siege on aunt Potema's castle. After they took it over and locked her up, they would move out of the inn and into the castle. Pelagius was not looking forward to that. The whole town had a funny, sweet, dead smell, but he could not get even as close as the castle moat without gagging from the stench. They could dump a million flowers on the place and it wouldn't make any difference at all.\nHe walked through the city for hours, buying some food and then some ribbons for his sister and mother back in Lilmoth. He thought about who else he needed to buy gifts for and was stumped. All his cousins, the children of Uncle Cephorus, Uncle Antiochus, and Aunt Potema, had died during the war, some of them in battle and some of them during the famines because so many crops had been burned. Aunt Bianki had died last year. There was only he, his mother, his sister, his father, and his uncle the Emperor left. And Aunt Potema. But she didn't really count.\nWhen he came upon the Mages Guild earlier that morning, he had decided not to go in. Those places always spooked him with their strange smoke and crystals and old books. This time, it occurred to Pelagius that he might buy a gift for Uncle Cephorus. A souvenir of Solitude's Mages Guild.\nAn old woman was having trouble with the front door, so Pelagius opened it for her.\n\"Thank you,\" she said.\nShe was easily the oldest thing he had ever seen. Her face looked like an old rotted apple framed with a wild whirl of bright white hair. He instinctively moved away from her gnarled talon when she started to pat him on the head. But there was a gem around her neck that immediately fascinated him. It was a single bright yellow jewel, but it almost looked there was something trapped within. When the light hit it from the candles, it brought out the form of a four-legged beast, pacing.\n\"It's a soul gem,\" she said. \"Infused with the spirit of a great demon werewolf. It was enchanted long, long ago with the power to charm people, but I've been thinking about giving it another spell. Perhaps something from the School of Alteration like Lock or Shield.\" She paused and looked at the boy carefully with yellowed, rheumy eyes. \"You look familiar to me, boy. What's your name?\"\n\"Pelagius,\" he said. He normally would have said \"Prince Pelagius,\" but he was told not to draw attention to himself while in town.\n\"I used to know someone named Pelagius,\" the old woman said, and slowly smiled. \"Are you here alone, Pelagius?\"\n\"My father is... with the army, storming the castle. But he'll be back when the walls have been breached.\"\n\"Which I dare say won't take too much longer,\" sighed the old woman. \"Nothing, no matter how well built, tends to last. Are you buying something in the Mages Guild?\"\n\"I wanted to buy a gift for my uncle,\" said Pelagius. \"But I don't know if I have enough gold.\"\nThe old woman left the boy to look over the wares while she went to the Guild enchanter. He was a young Nord, ambitious, and new to the kingdom of Solitude. It took little persuasion and a lot of gold to convince him to remove the charm spell from the soul gem and imbue it with a powerful curse, a slow poison that would drain wisdom from its wearer year by year until he or she lost all reason. She also purchased a cheap ring of fire resistance.\n\"For your kindness to an old woman, I've bought you these,\" she said, giving the boy the necklace and the ring. \"You can give the ring to your uncle, and tell him it has been enchanted with a levitation spell, so if ever he needs to leap from high places, it will protect him. The soulgem is for you.\"\n\"Thank you,\" said the boy. \"But this is too kind of you.\"\n\"Kindness has nothing to do with it,\" she answered, quite honestly. \"You see, I was in the Hall of Records at the Imperial Palace once or twice, and I read about you in the foretellings of the Elder Scrolls. You will be Emperor one day, my boy, the Emperor Pelagius Septim III, and with this soul gem to guide you, posterity will always remember you and your deeds.\"\nWith those words, the old woman disappeared down an alley behind the Mages Guild. Pelagius looked after her, but he did not think to search behind a heap of stones. If he had, he would have found a tunnel under the city into the very heart of Castle Solitude. And if he had found his way there, he would have found, past the shambling undead and the moldering remains of a once grand palace, the bedroom of the queen.\nIn that bedroom, he would find the Wolf Queen of Solitude in repose, listening to the sounds of her castle collapsing. And he would see a toothless grin growing on her face as she breathed her last.\n\nFrom the pen of Inzolicus, Second Century Sage:\n3E 137:\nPotema Septim died after a month long siege on her castle. While she lived, she had been the Wolf Queen of Solitude, Daughter of the Emperor Pelagius II, Wife of King Mantiarco, Aunt of the Empress Kintyra II, Mother of Emperor Uriel III, and Sister of the Emperors Antiochus and Cephorus. At her death, Magnus appointed his son, Pelagius, as the titular head of Solitude, under guidance from the royal council.\n3E 140:\nThe Emperor Cephorus Septim died after falling from his horse. His brother was proclaimed the Emperor Magnus Septim.\n3E 141:\nPelagius, King of Solitude, is recorded as \"occasionally eccentric\" in the Imperial Annals. He marries Katarish, Duchess of Vvardenfell.\n3E 145:\nThe Emperor Magnus Septim dies. His son, who will be known as Pelagius the Mad, is coronated."

There, he hoped to live in peace with his family.\nThe woodcutter's family lived well for a time, but without warning, the weather turned bitterly cold and spoiled the harvest. Before long, with their meager supply of food all but gone, the family was starving.\nLate one snowy night, a traveler knocked on the cabin door seeking shelter from the biting cold. Always generous of heart, the woodcutter welcomed the stranger into his home, apologizing that he had no food to offer.\nWith a smile, the traveler cast off his cloak to reveal the garments of a mage. As the woodcutter and his family looked on, the mysterious visitor reached into his satchel and withdrew a scroll tied with a silver ribbon. No sooner had the wizard unfurled the scroll and read the words aloud, when a great feast appeared from out of thin air. That night, nobody in the woodcutter's cabin went hungry.\nDay by day, the snow piled up. Every night, the mage produced another scroll from his bag and read the words, each time summoning a new feast. On the fifth night, the woodcutter's wife awoke her husband to confess her mistrust of their magical guest. Surely, she argued, there was some price to pay for the magical feasts that everyone enjoyed night after night.\nThe woodcutter would have none of it. After nearly dying from the lack of food, his family was eating well. The divines had sent them a gift, he explained, and it was foolish to question their wisdom.\nBut the woodcutter's wife would not be persuaded. Every night, she grew more fearful and more desperate. She was certain that the family had entered into a devil's bargain, and the time would soon come when the mage would ask for something unspeakable in return for his gifts.\nWhile everyone in the cabin slept, the woodcutter's wife snuck out of bed and took her husband's axe in hand. She crept into the traveler's room and with one swing, lopped off his head.\nSuddenly, the wizard's disembodied head awoke. His eyes opened wide and when he beheld his maimed body, he let forth a terrible cry.\nAwakened by the horrified scream, the woodcutter and his children rushed into the room and gasped at the terrible sight of the decapitated mage.\nWith his last gasp of breath, the traveler laid a fearful curse on the woodcutter's wife. After her mortal death, she was damned to rise once again and walk the woods alone only to burn at the rising of the sun.\nTo this day, those who walk the pine forest late at night tell tales of a weeping woman glimpsed between the trees. She carries a bloody axe, the stories say, and is terrifying to behold."

    "description": "Never steal from a women on her wedding day",
    "text": "(translated by Apthorne)\n\n\"The poets are right.  There is something life-changing about being in love,\" said Kepkajna gra-Minfang, sometimes called the Wraith. \"I haven't wanted to rob anyone or anything in weeks.  Why, the other day, I saw the door wide open at a wealthy merchant's house, but my mind was fully occupied with what I should wear on my wedding day.\"\n\"You have been out of the right society for very long now,\" frowned her friend Khargol approvingly. \"You never told me what happened to your first husband, you know, the one the shaman gave you?\"\n\"Torn apart by ash ghouls,\" smiled Kepkajna dreamily. \"It was rather saddish.  But I know nothing like that would happen to Wodworg.  No life of adventure for him.  He's practically an Imperial.  In fact, he is one.  Did I tell you how we met?\"\n\"Hundreds of times,\" grumbled Khargol, reaching for his flagon. \"He was your jailer, and he refused you food until you promised to marry him.\"\n\"Have you ever heard of anything so madly romantic in all your life?\" sighed Kepkajna, and then grew serious. \"I was going to say that I hope my old friends will wish me well, but as Old Bosriel used to say, there's no point in hoping for what cannot be.  We'll leave with the Imperial Knights for Balmora immediately after the wedding, but as long as we're in Dagon Fel, the gang will find some way of disrupting my love life and bring me back to the light.  I know it.\"\nAs the days approached towards the Wraith's wedding day, there was certainly something sinister in the air that Kepkajna could smell when she was not transported by heady bliss.  Dark figures seemed to shift in the shadows and disappear when approached.  She recognized the clothing of some beggars near Wodworg's cottage as costumes, but the mendicants hurried away before she could recognize which of her old gang was stalking her.\nBut these moments of apprehension were few.  Kepkajna was truly happy, making arrangements for the ceremony to be performed at the very dungeon where Wodworg had imprisoned her.  Her father was long since dead -- another victim of the ash ghouls -- but her fiance's commander volunteered to act in his behalf.  Of course, Kepkajna had to supply her own dowry.  She spent every last mark of her savings of ill-gotten gain to buy her beloved a truly wonderful present.\nThe wedding was set for the stroke of midnight, as is Orc tradition.  The handmaidens, wives of Imperial officers, were busily sewing her into her gown of red velvet and fine gold filigree in the mid-morning.  Dolcetta, one of the handmaidens, remarked that she had heard that Kepkajna had bought Wodworg a truly beautiful gift for her dowry.\n\"Let me show it to you,\" Kepkajna giggled, dashing from the room half-dressed to her hidden alcove.  The present had been stolen.\nThe women were horrified, but the Wraith found herself merely irritated, not surprised.  This was truly the old gang's style.  They knew that a wedding ceremony without a dowry was marked as unlucky.  She asked her handmaidens to finish dressing her quickly while she pondered what the burglars would have done with her treasure.\nThe whole region was honeycombed with secret lairs and abandoned sites thieves used to store their loot.  There were obvious places, of course, but after much reflection, she thought of where she would have put it under similar circumstances.  Once the handmaids had finished, Kepkajna bade them to make certain that the ceremony went on as scheduled, and not to fret as she might be a little late.  She wrapped herself in a shawl to protect her gown from dungeon dust and set off for the Shrine of Malacath.\nThe Wraith had never before attempted to rob her own friends, and though she was peeved at them for trying to ruin her happiness, she had no interest in hurting them physically.  Her style was to avoid conflict, though she knew it would be inevitable.  The lessons her mentor Khargol had given her had helped her avoid the lances and blades of guards and Imperial Knights over the years: now she would see if they would allow her to survive a den of thieves and the unknown dangers of the Shrine.  Without, most importantly, ruining her dress.\nThe desolate place was so empty as she delved into it that she feared she might have made a miscalculation.  It was not until she found the small room hidden down a long corridor that she knew she was at the right place, and that it was well suited for an ambush.  She grabbed the chest with her treasure within, and turned to face the assault.\nTwo of her old gang, Yorum and Yohr-i the Redguard twin brother and sister, were outside the door as she came from the room.  They knew the Wraith better than to taunt her and immediately attacked.  Yorum struck out with a left thrust of his blade while Yohr-i sought to rush her.  The Wraith neatly sidestepped Yohr-i, while dropping her weight to her rear left leg, shifting her right shoulder to the left to slip past Yorum's strike.  The twins crashed into one another and Kepkajna passed swiftly on.\nAlmost immediately, she was set on by the Argonian Binyaar, his mace whistling through the air at her head.  They had never much liked one another.  The Wraith snapped into a duck, so the mace whacked with a tremendous clamor against the stone wall.  Binyaar was thrown off balance, giving her a few seconds lead hurrying up the passage.  Ahead she could smell the fresh night air.\nThe last of her dowry's defenders was Sorogth, an Orc with whom she had shared a brief romance.  It was he who Kepkajna knew had masterminded the theft.  In a way and in context, she thought, his devotion to her misery was rather sweet.  At the moment, though, she was most concerned with avoiding his barbed ax that seemed ideal for breaking her dress's fine stitchwork and the flesh beneath.\nBending her knees slightly, bobbing to avoid strikes to the head, weaving her head to confuse Sorogth of her next move, shuffling her feet arrhythmically, the Wraith made an impossible target.  She ducked inside his thrusts, sidestepped his swings, and then sidestepped his thrusts, and ducked his swings.  As erratic as she tried to make her defensive moves, Sorogth still kept pace with her, refusing to budge from his position at the dungeon outlet.\nMidnight was coming, and the Wraith finally decided that she must end the confrontation.  When Sorogth swung out next, she sidestepped to her left, swayed down, and ducked her head, so the ax whistled over her right shoulder.  In that instant, his right side was exposed, and she reluctantly smashed the chest hard into his torso.  There was not enough time for Kepkajna to see if she had killed him or merely knocked him unconscious.  In truth, she thought of nothing else but rushing to her wedding ceremony.\nAt precisely midnight, Wodworg and Kepkajna were united together.  He was delighted with her dowry gift, a fine suit of armor that would make him the envy of other Imperial jailers.  Even more, he was enchanted by his wife's tale of retrieving it from the Shrine of Malacath.\n\"Did it occur to you to put on the armor when you knew that it was an ambush?\" he asked.\n\"I didn't want to dent your present,\" she replied, between kisses. \"And I certainly didn't want to wrinkle my gown.\""

    "text": "The last known sighting of a dragon in Tamriel was in the time of Tiber Septim. He made a pact with the few remaining dragons, swearing to protect them if they would serve him. Despite his promise, dragons were still hunted and slain. It's not clear if the last ones fled Tamriel or if they were exterminated.\nThere is no credible story of how dragons came to be. According to dremora that the College of Whispers have \"questioned,\" they just were, and are. Eternal, immortal, unchanging, and unyielding. They are not born or hatched. They do not mate or breed. There are no known examples of dragon eggs or dragonlings. The Iliac Bay area has stories of such things, but so far all have proven false. The eggs turned out to be eggs of other reptiles. The small dragons were merely oversized lizards and no relation to true dragons.\nAlthough they are not born, dragons can die. During the Dragon War of the Merethic Era, their numbers were decimated. The Akaviri invaders of the late First Era are said to have hunted and killed scores of them, before and after their defeat by Emperor Reman. Some sources say the Akaviri brought over dragon-killing spells. Others claim they built cunning traps. One tale even speaks of a rare poison.\nIt is well accepted that a dragon's most fearsome weapon is its fiery breath. Because they could fly overhead and rain down flaming death, archers and wizards were necessary when hunting them. It is less well known that some dragons could breathe a freezing spray of frost. The reports indicate that dragon might do one or the other, but not both.\nMost people think of dragons as mere beasts. However, logically they must have had language in order for Tiber Septim to have negotiated with them. Indeed, the historical record is quite clear that dragons were highly intelligent. They had their own language, but could also speak the languages of men and elves.\nThe records of Reman's hunts contain reports of dragons that breathe or spit fire. Recently some were unearthed that described dragons blowing freezing blasts of cold. The more fanciful tales have them summoning storms and even stopping time. These should be discounted as myths and faery tales. Even without this most fearsome weapon, their nearly impenetrable hide and granite-like teeth and claws made them terrifying opponents.\nThere is some confusion over when the last dragon was killed. It seems the last few vanished all at once. Some tales speak of a dragon king who devoured all of them rather than let mankind kill them. One of the more far-fetched stories has Tiber Septim absorbing their essences when he ascended to godhood. Although the exact cause is unknown, they are all gone. No dragon has been seen for centuries. There are a few known examples of dragon bones fused with the stone and rocks of cliffs and caves. Just enough proof to make the stories undeniable."

    "description": "A thief's most valiant theft.",
    "text": "Let me tell the tale of the Thief of Virtue. In the land of Hammerfell in the city of Sutch there lived a Baron who was quite wealthy. He was a noted collector of rare coins. The Baroness Veronique found the whole thing quite tedious. However, she did appreciate the lifestyle that the Baron's wealth provided.\nRavius Terinus was a noted thief. He claimed to be a master thief in the mythical guild of thieves. However, that was most likely just braggadocio. The only known Thieves Guild was wiped out over 450 years ago.\nRavius decided that the Baron should share his wealth. Specifically he should share it with Ravius. The wily thief crept into the Baron's castle one night intending to do just that.\nThe walls of the castle were noted for their height and unscalability. Ravius cleverly used an Arrow of Penetration to affix a rope to the top of the battlements. Once on the battlements, he had to evade the Baron's guards. By hiding in the shadows of the crenelations, he was able to work his way to the keep undetected.\nEntering the keep was child's play for a thief of his caliber. However, a cunning lock with no less than 13 pins protected the private quarters of the Baron. Ravius broke only 9 lockpicks to open it. Using only a fork, a bit of string, and a wineskin, he disabled the seven traps guarding the Baron's coin collection. Truly Ravius was a master among thieves.\nWith the coins safely in his grasp, Ravius began his escape only to find the way blocked. The Baron had found the opened door and was raising the guard to scour the castle. Ravius fled deeper into the castle, one step ahead of the questing guards.\nHis only way out led through the boudoir of Baroness Veronique. He entered to find the lady preparing for bed. Now it should be said at this point that Ravius was noted for his handsome looks, while the Baroness was noted for her plainness. Both of these facts were immediately recognized by each of the pair.\n\"Doest thou come to plunder my virtue?\" asked the lady, all a tremble.\n\"Nay, fair lady,\" Ravius said, thinking quickly. \"Plunder be a harsh term to ply upon such a delicate flower as your virtue.\"\n\"I see thou hast made off with mine husbands precious coins.\"\n\tRavius looked deeply into her eyes and saw the only path by which he would escape this night with his life. It would require a double sacrifice.\n\"Though these coins are of rarest value, I have now found a treasure that is beyond all value,\" Ravius said smoothly. \"Tell me, oh beauteous one, why doest thy husband set seven deadly traps around these tawdry coins, but only a simple lock upon the door of his virtuous wife?\"\n\"Ignace protects those things that are dearest to him,\" Veronique replied with ire.\n\"I would give all the gold in my possession to spend but a moment basking in your radiance.\"\nWith that Ravius set down the coins he had worked so hard to steal. The Baroness swooned into his arms. When the captain of the guard asked to search her quarters, she hid Ravius most skillfully. She turned over the coins, claiming the thief dropped them when he fled out the window.\nWith that sacrifice made, Ravius steeled himself for the second. He robbed the lady Veronique of her virtue that night. He robbed her of it several times, lasting well into the wee hours of the morning. Exhausted, yet sated, he stole away in the pre-dawn hours."

It is said that such a pilgrim would be rewarded with the blessing of Mehrunes Razor, a vicious blade through which Dagon himself can claim the very souls of those it strikes.\nBenign intent compelled Ayleid folk to seek out the Nefarivigum.  Arrogance let them believe themselves capable of disbarring any who would seek the Razor.  So was built Varsa Baalim, a great, ringed, labyrinthine city, during the height of Ayleid rule.\nSure as death, pilgrims came to Varsa Baalim, and for years the Elves drove back many, until it came to pass that a vampire slipped into the city unnoticed.  Merfolk were touched with the foul affliction, throwing the city into a gathering storm of madness and ruin, and soon it seemed none was left to prevent the Razor from being recovered.\nThen, suddenly, Varsa Baalim was gone.  Historic accounts dispute whether it happened through some final safety, a natural cataclysm, or by the touch of the Divines themselves.  Whatever the cause, history agrees on the result: the mountains of the Eastern Niben swallowed Varsa Baalim, and the Nefarivigum with it, where has remained hidden since the early days of the First Era.\nIf the tale is true, then somewhere on the eastern fringes of the Niben Valley, where man's rule has scarcely reached through the years, the Nefarivigum still lies in wait, among a city of unliving abominations entombed within the cold bowels of the mountain."

    "text": "Varieties Of Daedra\nby\n\tAranea Drethan\n\tHealer and Dissident Priest\nThere is little chance of our ever understanding the various orders of Daedra and their relationships to the Daedra Lords and their dominions. Of the varieties of Daedra that appear in our world, and the varieties of their relationships to their fellows and their Daedra patrons, there is no end. In one place and time they are seen to be this, and in another place and time they are seen to be the opposite, and in another place and time they are seen to be both this and that, in completely contradictory terms.\nWhat Daedra serves this Prince? What Daedra gives orders, and what Daedra serves, and in what hierarchy, and under what circumstances? What Daedra exist in fellowship with one another, and what Daedra have eternal enmity to one another, and what Daedra are solitary, or social, and by turns solitary or social? There are no limits to the varieties of behaviors that may be observed, and in one place they may be this, and in another place they may that, and all rules describing them are always found to be contradictory and in exception to others.\nFurther, from whom may we seek answers to our questions about these orders? From mortals, who know little but what they may observe of another world? From the gods, who speak in riddles, of enigmas wrapped in mysteries, and who keep things from us, the better to preserve their dominion over us? From the Daedra themselves, who are never the models of straightforwardness or truthtelling, but rather are famous for misstatements and obfuscations?\nAnd even were the Daedra to speak the truth, how can we know if they know themselves, or that there is any truth about them that is to be known, or are all arrangements among the Daedra protean and ever subject to change?\nIn short, what is to be known is little, and and what is to be trusted is nothing.\nThese things being said, I shall venture to relate what I have observed and heard of the relationships of the servants of Lord Dagon in my brief service to the Telvanni Wizard Divayth Fyr, when I sought him out and offered to bring peace to the victims of corprus in his sanitarium, once the Prophecies of the Incarnate had been fulfilled, and Dagoth Ur had been destroyed, and the Blight had been banished from the island of Vvardenfell forever.\nDivayth Fyr told me that he, by choice, trafficked only with two Daedra Powers -- Mehrunes Dagon and Azura.\nAzura, he said, knew and understood all things, and declined to speak of these things, or only spoke in riddles.\nMehrunes Dagon, on the other hand, out of pride, fixity of purpose, and a predictable lack of subtlety in thought, knew nothing and understood nothing, and was inclined to speak freely and without falsehood.\nDivayth Fyr said that Dagon's chief servants, the Dremora, were like him in pride, fixed purpose, and lack of subtlety, with the addition of the peculiar traits of honor and loyalty, both within their class and within their relationship to Lord Dagon.\nAnd Divayth Fyr said that the Dremora were ordered into clans and castes, and these clans and castes were well-defined. Individual Dremora might rise or fall in ranks, or move back and forth among clans, but only when regulated by complex oaths, and only at the will and pleasure of their Lord Dagon.\nThe Dremora refer to themselves as 'The Kyn' ('the People'), contrasting themselves to other Daedra, whom they consider unthinking animals. The term 'kynaz' refers to a member of the Dremora race ('he of the Kyn').\nThe least of kyn castes are the Churls, the undistinguished rabble of the lowest rank of Dremora. Churls are obsequeous to superiors but ferociously cruel to humans and other Daedra.\nNext in rank are the Caitiffs, creatures of uncalculating zeal, energy without discrimination. Caitiffs are used as irregulars in the faction wars of the Daedra, as berserkers and shock troops, undisciplined and unreliable, but eager and willing.\nThe highest of the regular rank-and file of Dremora troops are the Kynvals, warrior-knights who have distinguished themselves in battle, and shown the deliberate steadiness of potential war leaders.\nAbove the rank and file warriors of the Churl, Caitiff, and Kynval castes are the officer castes.\nA Kynreeve is a clan sheriff or clan officer. Kynreeves are typically associated either with a clan fighting unit or an administrative office in the order of battle.\nThe Kynmarcher is the lord and high officer of a Daedric citadel, outpost, or gate. A Kymarcher's command is usually associated both with a unit and with a 'fief' -- a location or territory for which he is responsible.\nAbove the Kymarcher is the Markynaz, or 'grand duke'. A Markynaz is a lord of lords, and member of the Markyn, Mehrunes Dagon's Council of Lords.\nThe highest rank of Dremora is the Valkynaz, or 'prince'. This warrior duke is a member of the Valkyn, Mehrunes Dagon's personal guard. The Valkynaz are rarely encountered on Tamriel; normally they remain by Mehrunes Dagon's side, or serve as commanders of operations of particular importance or interest to Dagon.\nOf the varieties of other Daedra I encountered while I served in Divayth Fyr's Corprusarium -- Ogrims and Golden Saints, Daedroths and Winged Twilights, Scamps and Clannfear -- there is much that might be said, but little that is helpful or reliable.\nI did note, however, that when Divayth Fyr sought a Daedra of a character like unto the Dremora, but of greater power, and greater inclination for independence and initiative, or solely as a master, he summoned Xivilai, who are like the Dremora in personality and temperment, except that they hate subordination, and are liable to disloyalty and betrayal when they feel they have not been treated with the proper deference and respect.\nThe feral, beastlike Daedra like the Clannfear and the Daedroth appear in the service of many different Daedric Powers, and may represent common creatures existing like wild animals in the wildernesses of Oblivion. Other savage, semi-intelligent creatures like Scamps and Spider Daedra may also be found in the realms of various Daedra Lords.\nThe case of the Elemental Atronachs, on the other hand, is less certain. Flame and Frost Atronachs, for example, appear to be highly intelligent, but not all varieties of Elemental Atronachs seem to be social or to have the power of speech. Divayth Fyr preferred not to summon or deal with these creatures, had little experience with them, and showed no inclination to speculate upon their nature, so I learned little about them during my time at Tel Fyr."

    "description": "The compiled listing of Gods of the Empire formerly known as \"The Pantheon\". Contains lots of interesting information.",
    "text": "This is my best attempt at a listing of the pantheons and associated divine spirits of Tamriel's dominant cultures. This list is by no means complete (the Imperial City of Cyrodiil alone boasts a vast host of saints and holy spirits). It only includes the most important spirits revered by native members of the culture. Other et'Ada, especially Daedra, are often familiar known to many cultures, though specific names are included here only when they possess a particular cultural significance. The omission of any reference to the worships of the Argonians of Black Marsh is a result of my complete inadequacy in reconciling the obscure and contradictory accounts available to me on that subject.\nTHE EIGHT PANTHEONS\nCYRODIIL: Akatosh, Dibella, Arkay, Zenithar, Mara, Stendarr, Kynareth, Julianos, Shezarr, Tiber Septim, Morihaus, Reman\nSKYRIM: Alduin, Dibella, Orkey, Tsun, Mara, Stuhn, Kyne, Jhunal, Shor, Ysmir, Herma-Mora, Maloch\nALTMER: Auri-El, Trinimac, Magnus, Syrabane, Y'ffre, Xarxes, Mara, Stendarr, Lorkhan, Phynaster\nBOSMER: Auri-El, Y'ffre, Arkay, Z'en, Xarxes, Baan Dar, Mara, Stendarr, Lorkhan, Herma-Mora, Jone, Jode\nDUNMER: Almalexia, Vivec, Sotha Sil, Boethiah, Mephala, Azura, Lorkhan, Nerevar, Molag Bal, Malacath, Sheogorath, Mehrunes Dagon\nYOKUDA: Satakal, Ruptga, Tu'whacca, Zeht, Morwha, Tava, Malooc, Diagna, Sep, HoonDing, Leki, Onsi,\nBRETONY: Akatosh, Magnus, Y'ffre, Dibella, Arkay, Zenithar, Mara, Stendarr, Kynareth, Julianos, Sheor, Phynaster\nELSWEYR: Alkosh, Khenarthi, Riddle'Thar, ja-Kha'jay, Mara, S'rendarr, Lorkhaj, Rajhin, Baan Dar, Azurah, Sheggorath\nNOTES ON THE DIVINE SPIRITS OF THE PANTHEONS\nAkatosh (Dragon God of Time): Akatosh is the chief deity of the Nine Divines (the major religious cult of Cyrodiil and its provinces), and one of two deities found in every Tamrielic religion (the other is Lorkhan). He is generally considered to be the first of the Gods to form in the Beginning Place; after his establishment, other spirits found the process of being easier and the various pantheons of the world emerged. He is the ultimate God of the Cyrodilic Empire, where he embodies the qualities of endurance, invincibility, and everlasting legitimacy.\nAlduin (World Eater): Alduin is the Nordic variation of Akatosh, and only superficially resembles his counterpart in the Nine Divines. For example, Alduin's sobriquet, 'the world eater', comes from myths that depict him as the horrible, ravaging firestorm that destroyed the last world to begin this one. Nords therefore see the god of time as both creator and harbinger of the apocalypse. He is not the chief of the Nordic pantheon (in fact, that pantheon has no chief; see Shor, below) but its wellspring, albeit a grim and frightening one.\nAlkosh (Dragon King of Cats): Pre-ri'Datta Dynasty Anaquinine deity. A variation on the Altmeri Auri-El, and thus an Akatosh-as-culture-hero for the earliest Khajiiti. His worship was co-opted during the establishment of the Riddle-T'har, and he still enjoys immense popularity in Elsweyr's wasteland regions. He is depicted as a fearsome dragon, a creature the Khajiit say 'is just a real big cat'. He repelled an early Aldmeri pogrom of Pelinal Whitestrake during mythic times.\nAlmalexia (Mother Morrowind): Most traces of Akatosh disappeared from ancient Chimer legends during their so-called 'exodus', primarily due to that god's association and esteem with the Altmeri. However, most aspects of Akatosh which seem so important to the mortal races, namely immortality, historicity, and genealogy, have conveniently resurfaced in Almalexia, the most popular of Morrowind's divine Tribunal.\nArkay (God of the Cycle of Life and Death): Member of the Nine Divines pantheon, and popular elsewhere as well. Arkay is often more important in those cultures where his father, Akatosh, is either less related to time or where his time aspects are difficult to comprehend by the layman. He is the god of burials and funeral rites, and is sometimes associated with the seasons. His priests are staunch opponents of necromancy and all forms of the undead. It is said that Arkay did not exist before the world was created by the gods under Lorkhan's supervision/urging/trickery. Therefore, he is sometimes called the Mortals' God.\nAuri-El (King of the Aldmer): The Elven Akatosh is Auri-El. Auri-El is the soul of Anui-El, who, in turn, is the soul of Anu the Everything. He is the chief of most Aldmeri pantheons. Most Altmeri and Bosmeri claim direct descent from Auri-El. In his only known moment of weakness, he agreed to take his part in the creation of the mortal plane, that act which forever sundered the Elves from the spirit worlds of eternity. To make up for it, Auri-El led the original Aldmer against the armies of Lorkhan in mythic times, vanquishing that tyrant and establishing the first kingdoms of the Altmer, Altmora and Old Ehlnofey. He then ascended to heaven in full observance of his followers so that they might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane.\nAzura (Goddess of Dusk and Dawn): Azura was the god-ancestor that taught the Chimer the mysteries needed to be different than the Altmer. Some of her more conventional teachings are sometimes attributed to Boethiah. In the stories, Azura is often more a communal cosmic force for the race as a whole than an ancestor or a god. Also known as the Anticipation of Sotha Sil. In Elsweyr, Azurah is nearly a wholly separate entity, yet she is still tied into the origins of Khajiiti out of Altmeri stock.\nBaan Dar (The Bandit God): In most regions, Baan Dar is a marginal diety, a trickster spirit of thieves and beggars. In Elsweyr he is more important, and is regarded as the Pariah. In this aspect, Baan Dar becomes the cleverness or desperate genius of the long-suffering Khajiit, whose last minute plans always upset the machinations of their (Elven or Human) enemies.\nBoethiah (Prince of Plots): Heralded by the Prophet Veloth, Boethiah is the original god-ancestor of the Dark Elves. Through his illuminations, the eventual 'Chimer', or Changed Folk, renounced all ties to the Aldmer and founded a new nation based on Daedric principles. All manner of Dark Elven cultural 'advances' are attributed to Boethiah, from philosophy to magic to 'responsible' architecture. Ancient Velothi allegories are uniformly heroic successes of Boethiah over enemies of every type, foundation stories of Chimeri struggle. Also known as the Anticipation of Almalexia.\nDiagna (Orichalc God of the Sideways Blade): Hoary thuggish cult of the Redguards. Originated in Yokuda during the Twenty Seven Snake Folk Slaughter. Diagna was an avatar of the HoonDing (the Yokudan God of Make Way, see below) that achieved permanence. He was instrumental to the defeat of the Lefthanded Elves, as he brought orichalc weapons to the Yokudan people to win the fight. In Tamriel, he led a very tight knit group of followers against the Orcs of Orsinium during the height of their ancient power, but then faded into obscurity. He is now little more than a local power spirit of the Dragontail mountains.\nDibella (Goddess of Beauty): Popular god of the Nine Divines. In Cyrodiil, she has nearly a dozen different cults, some devoted to women, some to artists and aesthetics, and others to erotic instruction.\nHerma-Mora (The Woodland Man): Ancient Atmoran demon who, at one time, nearly seduced the Nords into becoming Aldmer. Most Ysgramor myths are about escaping the wiles of old Herma-Mora. Also called the Demon of Knowledge, he is vaguely related to the cult origins of the Morag Tong ('Foresters Guild'), if only by association with his brother/sister, Mephala.\nHoonDing (The Make Way God): Yokudan spirit of 'perseverance over infidels'. The HoonDing has historically materialized whenever the Redguards need to 'make way' for their people. In Tamrielic history this has only happened three times -- twice in the first era during the Ra Gada invasion and once during the Tiber War. In this last incarnation, the HoonDing was said to have been either a sword or a crown, or both.\nJhunal (Rune God): The Nordic god of hermetic orders. After falling out of favor with the rest of that pantheon, he became Julianos of the Nine Divines. He is absent in modern Skyrim mythology.\nJode (Big Moon God): Aldmeri god of the Big Moon. Also called Masser or Mara's Tear. In Khajiti religion, Jode is only one aspect of the Lunar Lattice, or ja-Kha'jay.\nJone (Little Moon God): Aldmeri god of the Little Moon. Also called Secunda or Stendarr's Sorrow. In Khajiti religion, Jone is only one aspect of the Lunar Lattice, or ja-Kha'jay.\nJulianos (God of Wisdom and Logic): Often associated with Jhunal, the Nordic father of language and mathematics, Julianos is the Cyrodilic god of literature, law, history, and contradiction. Monastic orders founded by Tiber Septim and dedicated to Julianos are the keepers of the Elder Scrolls.\nKyne (Kiss At the End): Nordic Goddess of the Storm. Widow of Shor and favored god of warriors. She is often called the Mother of Men. Her daughters taught the first Nords the use of the thu'um, or Storm Voice.\nKynareth (Goddess of Air): Kynareth is a member of the Nine Divines, the strongest of the Sky spirits. In some legends, she is the first to agree to Lorkhan's plan to invent the mortal plane, and provides the space for its creation in the void. She is also associated with rain, a phenomenon said not to occur before the removal of Lorkhan's divine spark.\nLeki (Saint of the Spirit Sword): Goddess daughter of Tall Papa, Leki is the goddess of aberrant swordsmanship. The Na-Totambu of Yokuda warred to a standstill during the mythic era to decide who would lead the charge against the Lefthanded Elves. Their swordmasters, though, were so skilled in the Best Known Cuts as to be matched evenly. Leki introduced the Ephemeral Feint. Afterwards, a victor emerged and the war with the Aldmer began.\nLorkhan (The Missing God): This Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every Tamrielic mythic tradition. His most popular name is the Aldmeri 'Lorkhan', or Doom Drum. He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the mortal plane, upsetting the status quo -- much like his father Padomay had introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhan is separated from his divine center, sometimes involuntarily, and wanders the creation of the et'Ada. He and his metaphysical placement in the 'scheme of things' is interpreted a variety of ways. In Morrowind, for example, he is a being related to the Psijiic Endeavor, a process by which mortals are charged with transcending the gods that created them. To the High Elves, he is the most unholy of all higher powers, as he forever broke their connection to the spirit plane. In the legends, he is almost always an enemy of the Aldmer and, therefore, a hero of early Mankind.\nLorkhaj (Moon Beast): Pre-ri'Datta Dynasty Anaquinine deity, easily identified with the Missing God, Lorkhan.\nMagnus (Magus): The god of sorcery, Magnus withdrew from the creation of the world at the last second, though it cost him dearly. What is left of him on the world is felt and controlled by mortals as magic. One story says that, while the idea was thought up by Lorkhan, it was Magnus who created the schematics and diagrams needed to construct the mortal plane. He is sometimes represented by an astrolabe, a telescope, or, more commonly, a staff. Cyrodilic legends say he can inhabit the bodies of powerful magicians and lend them his power. Associated with Zurin Arctus, the Underking.\nMalacath (God of Curses): Malacath is the reanimated dung that was Trinimac. A somewhat weak but vengeful Daedra, the Dark Elves say he is also Malak, the god-king of the orcs. He always tests the Dunmer for physical weakness.\nMalooc (Horde King): An enemy god of the Ra Gada. Led the goblins against the Redguards during the first era. Fled east when the army of the HoonDing overtook his goblin hordes.\nMauloch (Malacath): An Orcish god, Mauloch troubled the heirs of King Harald for a long time. Fled east after his defeat at the Battle of Dragon Wall, ca. 1E660. His rage was said to fill the sky with his sulphurous hatred, later called the \"Year of Winter in Summer\".\nMara (Goddess of Love): Nearly universal goddess. Origins started in mythic times as a fertility goddess. In Skyrim, Mara is a handmaiden of Kyne. In the Empire, she is Mother-Goddess. She is sometimes associated with Nir of the 'Anuad', the female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation. Depending on the religion, she is either married to Akatosh or Lorkhan, or the concubine of both.\nMehrunes Dagon (God of Destruction): Popular Daedric power. He is associated with natural dangers like fire, earthquakes, and floods. In some cultures, though, Dagon is merely a god of bloodshed and betrayal. He is an especially important deity in Morrowind, where he represents its near-inhospitable terrain.\nMephala (Androgyne): Mephala is the Webspinner, or the Spider God. In Morrowind, he/she was the ancestor that taught the Chimer the skills they would need to evade their enemies or to kill them with secret murder. Enemies were numerous in those days since the Chimer were a small faction. He/she, along with Boethiah, organized the clan systems that eventually became the basis for the Great Houses. He/she founded the Morag Tong. Also called the Anticipation of Vivec.\nMolag Bal (God of Schemes, King of Rape): Daedric power of much importance in Morrowind. There, he is always the archenemy of Boethiah, the Prince of Plots. He is the main source of the obstacles to the Dunmer (and preceding Chimer) people. In the legends, Molag Bal always tries to upset the bloodlines of Houses or otherwise ruin Dunmeri 'purity'. A race of supermonsters, said to live in Molag Amur, are the result of his seduction of Vivec during the previous era.\nMorihaus (First Breath of Man): Ancient cultural hero god of the Cyro-Nordics. Legend portrays him as the Taker of the Citadel, an act of mythic times that established Human control over the Valley Heartland. He is often associated with the Nordic powers of thu'um, and therefore with Kynareth.\nMorwha (Teat God): Yokudan fertility goddess. Fundamental deity in the Yokudan pantheon, and the favorite of Tall Papa's wives. Still worshipped in various areas of Hammerfell, including Stros M'kai. Morwha is always portrayed as four-armed, so that she can 'grab more husbands'.\nNerevar (Godkiller): The Chimeri king of Resdayn, the Golden Age of old Veloth. Slain during the Battle of Red Mountain, Nerevar was the Herald of the Triune Way, and is the foremost of the saints of Dunmeri faith. He is said to have killed Dumac, the Last Dwarven King, and feasted on his heart.\nOnsi (Boneshaver): Notable warrior god of the Yokudan Ra Gada, Onsi taught Mankind how to pull their knives into swords.\nOrkey (Old Knocker): A loan-god of the Nords, who seem to have taken up his worship during Aldmeri rule of Atmora. Nords believe they once lived as long as Elves until Orkey appeared; through heathen trickery, he fooled them into a bargain that 'bound them to the count of winters'. At one time, legends say, Nords only had a lifespan of six years due to Orkey's foul magic. Shor showed up, though, and, through unknown means, removed the curse, throwing most of it onto the nearby Orcs.\nPhynaster: Hero-god of the Summerset Isles, who taught the Altmer how to naturally live another hundred years by using a shorter walking stride.\nRajhin (Footpad): Thief god of the Khajiiti, who grew up in the Black Kiergo section of Senchal. The most famous burglar in Elsweyr's history, Rajhin is said to have stolen a tattoo from the neck of Empress Kintyra as she slept.\nReman (The Cyrodiil): Culture god-hero of the Second Empire, Reman was the greatest hero of the Akaviri Trouble. Indeed, he convinced the invaders to help him build his own empire, and conquered all of Tamriel except for Morrowind. He instituted the rites of becoming Emperor, which included the ritual geas to the Amulet of Kings, a soulgem of immense power. His Dynasty was ended by the Dunmeri Morag Tong at the end of the first era. Also called the Worldly God.\nRiddle'Thar (Two-Moons Dance): The cosmic order deity of the Khajiiti, the Riddle'Thar was revealed to Elsweyr by the prophet Rid-Thar-ri'Datta, the Mane. The Riddle'Thar is more a set of guidelines by which to live than a single entity, but some of his avatars like to appear as humble messengers of the gods. Also known as the Sugar God.\nRuptga (Tall Papa): Chief deity of the Yokudan pantheon. Ruptga, more commonly 'Tall Papa', was the first god to figure out how to survive the Hunger of Satakal. Following his lead, the other gods learned the 'Walkabout', or a process by which they can persist beyond one lifetime. Tall Papa set the stars in the sky to show lesser spirits how to do this, too. When there were too many spirits to keep track of, though, Ruptga created a helper out the dead skin of past worlds. This helper is Sep (see below), who later creates the world of mortals.\nSatakal (The Worldskin): Yokudan god of everything. A fusion of the concepts of Anu and Padomay. Basically, Satakal is much like the Nordic Alduin, who destroys one world to begin the next. In Yokudan mythology, Satakal had done (and still does) this many times over, a cycle which prompted the birth of spirits that could survive the transition. These spirits ultimately become the Yokudan pantheon. Popular god of the Alik'r nomads.\nSheogorath (The Mad God): The fearful obeisance of Sheogorath is widespread, and is found in most Tamrielic quarters. Contemporary sources indicate that his roots are in Aldmeri creation stories; therein, he is 'born' when Lorkhan's divine spark is removed. One crucial myth calls him the 'Sithis-shaped hole' of the world.\nSheor (Bad Man): In Bretony, the Bad Man is the source of all strife. He seems to have started as the god of crop failure, but most modern theologians agree that he is a demonized version of the Nordic Shor, born during the dark years after the fall of Saarthal.\nSep (The Snake): Yokudan version of Lorkhan. Sep is born when Tall Papa creates someone to help him regulate the spirit trade. Sep, though, is driven crazy by the hunger of Satakal, and he convinces some of the gods to help him make an easier alternative to the Walkabout. This, of course, is the world as we know it, and the spirits who followed Sep become trapped here, to live out their lives as mortals. Sep is punished by Tall Papa for his transgressions, but his hunger lives on as a void in the stars, a 'non-space' that tries to upset mortal entry into the Far Shores.\nShezarr (God of Man): Cyrodilic version of Lorkhan, whose importance suffers when Akatosh comes to the fore of Imperial (really, Alessian) religion. Shezarr was the spirit behind all human undertaking, especially against Aldmeri aggression. He is sometimes associated with the founding of the first Cyrodilic battlemages. In the present age of racial tolerance, Shezarr is all but forgotten.\nShor (God of the Underworld): Nordic version of Lorkhan, who takes sides with Men after the creation of the world. Foreign gods (i.e., Elven ones) conspire against him and bring about his defeat, dooming him to the underworld. Atmoran myths depict him as a bloodthirsty warrior king who leads the Nords to victory over their Aldmeri oppressors time and again. Before his doom, Shor was the chief of the gods. Sometimes also called Children's God (see Orkey, above).\nSotha Sil (Mystery of Morrowind): God of the Dunmer, Sotha Sil is the least known of the divine Tribunal. He is said to be reshaping the world from his hidden, clockwork city.\nStendarr (God of Mercy): God of the Nine Divines, Stendarr has evolved from his Nordic origins into a deity of compassion or, sometimes, righteous rule. He is said to have accompanied Tiber Septim in his later years. In early Altmeri legends, Stendarr is the apologist of Men.\nStuhn (God of Ransom): Nordic precursor to Stendarr, brother of Tsun. Shield-thane of Shor, Stuhn was a warrior god that fought against the Aldmeri pantheon. He showed Men how to take, and the benefits of taking, prisoners of war.\nSyrabane (Warlock's God): An Aldmeri god-ancestor of magic, Syrabane aided Bendu Olo in the Fall of the Sload. Through judicious use of his magical ring, Syrabane saved many from the scourge of the Thrassian Plague. He is also called the Apprentices' God, for he is a favorite of the younger members of the Mages Guild.\nTava (Bird God): Yokudan spirit of the air. Tava is most famous for leading the Yokudans to the isle of Herne after the destruction of their homeland. She has since become assimilated into the mythology of Kynareth. She is still very popular in Hammerfell among sailors, and her shrines can be found in most port cities.\nTiber Septim (Talos, the Dragonborn): Heir to the Seat of Sundered Kings, Tiber Septim is the most important hero-god of Mankind. He conquered all of Tamriel and ushered in the Third Era (and the Third Empire). Also called Ysmir, 'Dragon of the North'.\nTrinimac: Strong god of the early Aldmer, in some places more popular than Auri-El. He was a warrior spirit of the original Elven tribes that led armies against the Men. Boethiah is said to have assumed his shape (in some stories, he even eats Trinimac) so that he could convince a throng of Aldmer to listen to him, which led to their eventual Chimeri conversion. He vanishes from the mythic stage after this, to return as the dread Malacath (Altmeri propaganda portrays this as the dangers of Dunmeri influence).\nTsun: Extinct Nordic god of trials against adversity. Died defending Shor from foreign gods.\nTu'whacca (Tricky God): Yokudan god of souls. Tu'whacca, before the creation of the world, was the god of Nobody Really Cares. When Tall Papa undertook the creation of the Walkabout, Tu'whacca found a purpose; he became the caretaker of the Far Shores, and continues to help Redguards find their way into the afterlife. His cult is sometimes associated with Arkay in the more cosmopolitan regions of Hammerfell.\nVivec (Master of Morrowind): Warrior-poet god of the Dunmer. Vivec is the invisible keeper of the holy land, ever vigilant against the dark gods of the Volcano. He/she has saved the Dunmeri people from certain death on numerous occasions, most notably when he/she taught them how to breathe water for a day so that he/she could flood Morrowind and kill the Akaviri invaders, ca. 2E572.\nXarxes: Xarxes is the god of ancestry and secret knowledge. He began as a scribe to Auri-El, and has kept track of all Aldmeri accomplishments, large and small, since the beginning of time. He created his wife, Oghma, from his favorite moments in history.\nY'ffre (God of the Forest): Most important deity of the Bosmeri pantheon. While Auri-El Time Dragon might be the king of the gods, the Bosmer revere Y'ffre as the spirit of 'the now'. According to the Wood Elves, after the creation of the mortal plane everything was in chaos. The first mortals were turning into plants and animals and back again. Then Y'ffre transformed himself into the first of the Ehlnofey, or 'Earth Bones'. After these laws of nature were established, mortals had a semblance of safety in the new world, because they could finally understand it. Y'ffre is sometimes called the Storyteller, for the lessons he taught the first Bosmer. Some Bosmer still possess the knowledge of the chaos times, which they can use to great effect (the Wild Hunt).\nYsmir (Dragon of the North): The Nordic aspect of Talos. He withstood the power of the Greybeards' voices long enough to hear their prophecy. Later, many Nords could not look on him without seeing a dragon.\nZ'en (God of Toil): Bosmeri god of payment in kind. Studies indicate origins in both Argonian and Akaviri mythologies, perhaps introduced into Valenwood by Kothringi sailors. Ostensibly an agriculture deity, Z'en sometimes proves to be an entity of a much higher cosmic order. His worship died out shortly after the Knhaten Flu.\nZeht (God of Farms): Yokudan god of agriculture. Renounced his father after the world was created, which is why Tall Papa makes it so hard to grow food.\nZenithar (God of Work and Commerce, Trader God): Member of the Nine Divines, Zenithar is understandably associated with Z'en. In the Empire, however, he is a far more cultivated god of merchants and middle nobility. His worshippers say, despite his mysterious origins, Zenithar is the god 'that will always win'."

    "text": "Hallgerd walked into the King's Ham that Loredas evening, his face clouded with sadness. While he ordered a mug of greef, his mates Garaz and Xiomara joined him with moderately sincere concern.\n\"What's wrong with you, Hallgerd?\" asked Xiomara. \"You're later than usual, and there's a certain air of tragedy you've dragged in with you. Have you lost money, or a nearest and dearest?\"\n\"I haven't lost any money,\" Hallgerd grimaced. \"But I've just received word from my nephew than my cousin Allioch has died. Perfectly natural, he says, just old age. Allioch was ten years younger than me.\"\n\"Aw, that's terrible. But it goes to show that it's important to savor all of life's possibilities, 'cause you never know when your time is coming,\" said Garaz, who had been sitting at the same stool at the smoky cornerclub for the last several hours. He was not one cursed with self-awareness.\n\"Life's short all right,\" agreed Xiomara. \"But if you'll pardon a sentimental thought, few of us are aware of the influence we'll have after our deaths. Perhaps there's comfort there. For example, have I told you the story about Vernaccus and Bourlor?\"\n\"I don't believe so,\" said Hallgerd.\nVernaccus was a daedra (said Xiomara, throwing a few dribbles on flin on the hearth to cast the proper mood), and though our tale took place many, many years ago, it would be fair to say that Vernaccus still is one. For what after all is time to the immortal daedra?\n\"Actually,\" Garaz interrupted. \"I understand that the notion of immortality--\"\n\"I am trying to offer our friend an inspirational tale in his hour of need,\" Xiomara growled. \"I don't have all bloody night to tell it, if you don't mind.\"\nYou wouldn't have heard of Vernaccus (said Xiomara, abandoning the theme of immortality for the time being) for even at the height of his power and fame, he was considered feeble by the admittedly high standards of the day. Of course, this lack of respect infuriated him, and his reaction was typical of lesser daedra. He went on a murderous rampage.\nSoon word spread through all the villages in the Colovian West of the unholy terror. Whole families had been butchered, castles destroyed, orchards and fields torched and cursed so nothing would ever grow there again.\nTo make things even worse for the villagers, Vernaccus began getting visitations from an old rival of his from Oblivion. She was a daedra seducer named Horavatha, and she delighted in taunting him to see how angry she could make him become.\n\"You've flooded a village and that's supposed to be impressive?\" she would sneer.\n\"Try collapsing a continent, and maybe you'll get a little attention.\"\nVernaccus could become pretty angry. He didn't come very close to collapsing the continent of Tamriel, but it wasn't for lack of trying.\nA hero was needed to face the mad daedra, and fortunately, one was available.\nHis name was Bourlor, and it was said that he had been blessed by the goddess Kynareth. That was the only explanation for his inhuman accuracy with his bow and arrow, for he never missed a target. As a child he had driven his marksmanship tutors wild with frustration. They would tell him how to plant his feet, how to nock a bolt, the proper grip for the cord, the best method of release. He ignored all the rules, and somehow, every time, the arrow would catch a breath of wind and sail directly to his target. It did not matter if the quarry was moving or still, at very close range or miles away. Whatever he wanted to strike with his arrow would be struck.\nBourlor answered the call when one of the village mayors begged him for help. Unfortunately, he was not as great a horseman as he was an archer. As he rode through the forest toward the mayor's town, a place called Evensacon, Vernaccus was already murdering everyone there. Horavatha watched, and stifled back a yawn.\n\"Murdering a small town mayor isn't going to put you in famous company, you know. What you need is a great champion to defeat. Someone like Ysgramor or Pelinal Whitestrake or--\" she stared at the figure emerging from the forest. \"That fellow!\"\n\"Who's he?\" growled Vernaccus between bites of the mayor's quivering body.\n\"The greatest archer in Tamriel. He's never missed.\"\nBourlor had his bow strung and was pointing it at the daedra. For a moment, Vernaccus felt like laughing -- the fellow was not even aiming straight -- but he had a well-honed sense of self-preservation. There was something about the man's look of confidence that convinced the daedra that Horavatha wasn't lying. As the bolt left the bow, Vernaccus vanished in a sheet of flame.\nThe arrow impaled a tree. Bourlor stood and stared. He had missed a target.\nIn Oblivion, Vernaccus raged. Fleeing before a mortal man like that -- not even the basest scamp would have been so craven. He had exposed himself for the weak, cowardly creature he was. As he considered what steps to take to salvage the situation, he found himself face-to-knee with the most fearsome of the Daedra Princes, Molag Bal.\n\"I never thought anything much of you, Vernaccus,\" the giant boomed. \"But you have more than proven your worth. You have shown the creatures of Mundus that the daedra are more powerful than the blessings of the Gods.\"\nThe other denizens of Oblivion quickly agreed (as they always did) with the view of Molag Bal. The daedra are, after all, always very sensitive about their various defeats at the hands of mortal champions. Vernaccus was proclaimed The Elusive Beast, The Unpursuable One, He Who Cannot Be Touched, The Bane of Kynareth. Shrines devoted to him began to be built in remote corners of Morrowind and Skyrim.\nBourlor meanwhile, now found flawed, was never again called to rescue a village. He was so heartbroken over his failure to strike his target that he became a hermit, and never restrung his bow again. Some months later, he died, unmourned and unremembered.\n\"Is this really the tale you thought would cheer me?\" asked Hallgerd incredulously. \n\"I've heard the King of Worms told more inspirational stories.\"\n\"Wait,\" smiled Xiomara. \"I'm not finished yet.\"\nFor a year's time, Vernaccus was content to watch his legend grow and his fledging worship spread from his home in Oblivion. He was, in addition to being cowardly and inclined toward murderous rages, also a very lazy creature. His worshippers told tales of their Master avoiding the bolts of a thousand archers, of moving through oceans without getting wet, and other feats of avoidance that he would rather not have to demonstrate in person. The real story of his ignominious retreat from Bourlor was thankfully forgotten.\nThe bad news, when it came, was delivered to him with some relish by Horavatha. He had delighted in her jealousy at his growing reputation, so it was with a cruel smile she told him, \"Your shrines are being assaulted.\"\n\"Who dares?\" he roared.\n\"Everyone who passes them in the wilderness feels the need to throw a stone,\" Horavatha purred. \"You can hardly blame them. After all, they represent He Who Cannot Be Touched. How could anyone be expected to resist such a target?\"\nVernaccus peered through the veil into the world of Mundus and saw that it was true. One of his shrines in Colovian West country was surrounded by a large platoon of mercenary soldiers, who delighted in pelting it with rocks. His worshippers huddled inside, praying for a miracle.\nIn an instant, he appeared before the mercenaries and his rage was terrifying to behold. They fled into the woods before he even had a chance to murder one of them. His worshippers threw open the wooden door to the shrine and dropped to their knees in joy and fear. His anger melted. Then a stone struck him.\nThen another. He turned to face his assailants, but the air was suddenly filled with rocks.\nVernaccus could not see them, but he heard mercenaries in the woods laugh, \"It's not even trying to move out of the way!\"\n\"It's impossible not to hit him!\" guffawed another.\nWith a roar of humiliation, the daedra bounded into the shrine, chased by the onslaught. One of the stones knocked the door closed behind him, striking him in the back. His face broke, anger and embarrassment disappearing, replaced by pain. He turned, shaking, to his worshippers who huddled in the shadows of the shrine, their faith shattered.\n\"Where did you get the wood to build this shrine?\" Vernaccus groaned.\n\"Mostly from a copse of trees near the village of Evensacon,\" his high-priest shrugged.\nVernaccus nodded. He dropped forward, revealing the deep wound in his back. A rusted arrowhead buried in a whorl in the wood of the door had jolted loose in the assault and impaled him. The daedra vanished in a whirlwind of dust.\nThe shrines were abandoned shortly thereafter, though Vernaccus did have a brief resurgence as the Patron Spirit of Limitations and Impotence before fading from memory altogether. The legend of Bourlor himself never became very well known either, but there are still some who tell the tale, like myself. And we have the advantage of knowing what the Great Archer himself didn't know on his deathbed -- his final arrow found its target after all."

    "text": "Little boys shouldn't summon up the forces of eternal darkness unless they have an adult supervising, I know, I know. But on that sunny night on the 5th of First Seed, I didn't want an adult. I wanted Hermaeus Mora, the daedra of knowledge, learning, gums, and varnishes. You see, I was told by a beautiful, large breasted man who lived under the library in my home town that the 5th of First Seed was Hermaeus Mora's night. And if I wanted the Oghma Infinium, the book of knowledge, I had to summon him. When you're the new king of Solitude, every bit of knowledge helps.\nNormally, you need a witches coven, or a mages guild, or at least matching pillow case and sheets to invoke a prince of Oblivion. The Man Under the Library showed me how to do it myself. He told me to wait until the storm was at its height before shaving the cat. I've forgotten the rest of the ceremony. It doesn't matter.\nSomeone appeared who I thought was Hermaeus Mora. The only thing that made me somewhat suspicious was Hermaeus Mora, from what I read, was a big blobby multi-eyed clawed monstrosity, and this guy looked like a waistcoated banker. Also, he kept calling himself Sheogorath, not Hermaeus Mora. Still, I was so happy to have successfully summoned Hermaeus Mora, these inconsistencies did not bother me. He had me do some things that didn't make any sense to me (beyond the mortal scope, breadth, and ken, I suppose), and then his servant happily gave me something he called the Wabbajack. Wabbajack. Wabbajack.\nWabbajack.\nWabbajack. Wabbajack. Wabbajack. Wabbajack. Wabbajack. Wabbajack.\nMaybe the Wabbajack is the Book of Knowledge. Maybe I'm smarter because I know cats can be bats can be rats can be hats can be gnats can be thats can be thises. And that doors can be boars can be snores can be floors can be roars can be spores can be yours can be mine. I must be smart, for the interconnective system is very clear to me. Then why, or wherefore do people keep calling me mad?\nWabbajack. Wabbajack. Wabbajack."

    "text": "Walking the World\nVolume XI: Solitude\nby\nSpatior Munius\nWelcome, friend. In our latest volume, we cover Solitude. Spatior could not be more pleased to be at the very seat of Imperial power in Skyrim. In the course of our tour, you'll see that Solitude's riches extend from her people to the history and architecture that make up the city itself.\nAs ever, we begin our journey outside the city walls, this time at the bottom of the hill that ascends all the way to Solitude's massive gates.\nSolitude's Surroundings\nBefore scaling the hill to the city, you should be sure to take in the sights. Wander the track that leads down to the docks, and you can stop to enjoy one of the best views of the Great Arch.\nOriginally serving as both a landmark and windbreak for Solitude's port, the easily-defended Great Arch also provided an ideal building site for the ancient Nords.\nThe city gradually grew to extend across the entire length of the arch. This growth culminated in the building of the Blue Palace, home of the High Kings and Queens of Skyrim. We will visit the palace later.\n\nThe Gates of Solitude\nEntrance to Solitude is guarded by two gates and three towers. The first of these towers, situated at the crossroads, is Sky Tower. It's mostly a lookout, although in times of war, barricades are erected across the nearby road to act as a first line of defense.\nThe second tower and first, smaller gate are collectively known as the Squall Gate. Here, attacking armies meet their first real resistance. Last and certainly most impressive is the Storm Gate.\nWhile Castle Dour, found just within the city's main gate, has always been a massive walled structure, Solitude's outer walls and gates were not added until shortly after the coronation of High King Erling.\nLooking up and to the left of the main gate, you can see a small hint of Erling's preference for a more rounded style of architecture that we will see later in the Castle Dour extension, as well as the interior arch and the windmill.\nNow we pass through the gates and enter the main shopping district of Solitude.\n\nThe Well District\nStepping inside Solitude's gates, you get your first view of the city itself. Rising tall and proud before you, banners waving from its crown, is the Emperor's Tower. Home to the Kings of Haafingar before the consolidation of Skyrim and the creation of the Blue Palace, the Emperor's Tower is now used exclusively as guest quarters for Emperors who come to visit the city.\nTo your left and right are Solitude's inn and shops. Here can be found some of the finest imported goods in Skyrim. After all, Solitude is a wealthy city with ready access to the major shipping lanes of Tamriel.\nContinuing ahead, you'll come to the ramp that takes you up to Castle Dour. From here, you can truly feel the weight of this stone bastion's looming presence. The left-most tower, topped by the pointed roof of Erling's extension, was once the castle barracks and jail. Today, the tower is the center of military power here in Solitude.\nLooking right past the looming Emperor's tower, you can glimpse Solitude's natural bridge arcing gracefully over to the windmill. Built during High King Erling's day, the bridge was said to be used used to discretely allow Captain Jytte, the famous privateer, to enter Castle Dour. Some historians claim that she and the High King were simply attempting to keep their business dealings quiet. Others believe the Jytte and Erling were involved on a more personal level.\nAt the end of the bridge is the windmill. The tower and the windmill serve as one of Solitude's most recognizable man-made landmarks. The Windmill's power was once used to open the gates to what is now the East Empire Company Warehouse, but today that task falls to the strong backs of the dock workers.\nIn the shadow of the windmill you'll find the outdoor market and the well. Here, you can buy a number of local delicacies including the famous spiced wine made exclusively in Solitude.\nFrom here we'll travel up the ramp and into Castle Dour Courtyard.\n\nCastle Dour\nAs you enter the courtyard of Castle Dour, you are confronted with the banner of Solitude hanging over the door to what is now Castle Dour proper.\nAt the far end of the courtyard stands the impressive Temple of the Divines. The founders of Solitude were deeply devout and Solitude is the only place in Skyrim where all of the divines are worshiped in a single temple. All three of the buildings here are well worth taking a look inside, but only the Temple and Castle Dour's military wing are open.\nIf you do venture inside the temple, take special note of the alcoves at the front. You can see the empty alcove that once held the shrine of Talos before Talos worship was outlawed.\nFrom the courtyard, travel out the exit between Castle Dour and the Temple and you'll get your first sight of the Blue Palace. Along the way, be sure to stop outside the Bards College, a large building on your left marked by the Flame of Callisos burning beside the steps.\nNamed for a famous bard, it is said that as long as the flame burns, the college will stand.\nThe Bards College\nLooking up from the Bards College steps, you can see that the college stands taller than the Blue Palace itself. The bards who train here can be heard throughout Skyrim, singing songs that capture the history of the ages. If you get a chance you should be sure to catch the Burning of King Olaf, an ancient festival where \"King Olaf\" is burned in effigy.\nContinue up the road from the college and you'll reach the courtyard of the Blue Palace, our final destination.\n\nThe Blue Palace\nThe Blue Palace is home to the Jarls of Solitude, who for centuries have also served as the High Kings and High Queens of Skyrim. The northeast wing, on your left as you enter, holds the living quarters of the Jarl and her court on the top level and various servants below.\nThe southwest wing, known as the Pelagius Wing, has fallen into a state of disrepair. Named for the famous High King, Pelagius the Mad, the wing is rumored to be haunted by the king's ghost. The wing has been locked and left alone since shortly after Pelagius's death.\nYou should be sure to venture inside the Blue Palace. The grand atrium and court chambers are a sight not to be missed.\n\nOther Points of Interest\nSpatior has shown you Solitude in all its grandeur, but there are a few places more to see. The walls of the city are easily accessible and well worth climbing for the remarkable view. The Solitude Docks are also worth a visit, as they are the largest in Skyrim.\nThat's all for Walking the World Volume XI. Spatior does not know his next destination yet, but you can be sure that where he does go he will leave you a record of the best things to see.\nSpatior Munius, World Traveler"

    "text": "This account by the Imperial scholar Agrippa Fundilius is based on various Imperial and Dunmer sources, and written for Western readers.\nThe War of the First Council was a First Age religious conflict between the secular Dunmer Houses Dwemer and Dagoth and the orthodox Dunmer Houses Indoril, Redoran, Dres, Hlaalu, and Telvanni. The First Council was the first pan-Dunmer governing body, which collapsed over disputes about sorceries and enchantments practiced by the Dwemer and declared profane by the other Houses.\nThe Secular Houses, less numerous, but politically and magically more advanced, and aided by Nord and Orc clans drawn by promise of land and booty, initially campaigned with great success in the north of Morrowind, and occupied much of the land now comprising Redoran, Vvardenfell, and Telvanni District. The Orthodox Houses, widely dispersed and poorly organized, suffered defeat after defeat until Nerevar was made general of all House troops and levies.\nNerevar secured the aid of nomad barbarian tribesmen, and contrived to force a major battle at the Secular stronghold of Red Mountain on Vvardenfell. The Secular forces were outmaneuvered and defeated with the help of Ashlander scouts, and the survivors forced to take refuge in the Dwemer stronghold at Red Mountain.\nAfter a brief siege, treason permitted Nerevar and his troops to enter the stronghold, where the Secular leaders were slain, and Nerevar mortally wounded. General slaughter followed, and Houses Dwemer and Dagoth were exterminated. Nerevar died shortly thereafter of his wounds.\nThree of Nerevar's associates among the Orthodox Houses, Vivec, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil, succeeded to control of the re-created First Council, re-named the Grand Council of Morrowind, and went on to be come the god-kings and immortal rulers of Morrowind known as the Tribunal, or Almsivi."

It would be easy to dismiss the whole matter as nonsense were it not for the Amulet of Kings. Even the Elder Scrolls do not mention it -- let me correct myself, the Elder Scrolls cannot mention it. When the Moth priests attune the Scrolls to the timeless time their glyphs always disappear. The Amulet of Kings, however, with its oversoul of emperors, can speak of it at length. According to Hestra, Cyrodiil became an Empire across the stars. According to Shor-El, Cyrodiil became an egg. Most say something in a language they can only speak sideways. The Council has collected texts and accounts from all of its provinces, and they only offer stories that never coincide, save on one point: all the folk of Tamriel during the Middle Dawn, in whatever 'when' they were caught in, tracked the fall of the eight stars. And that is how they counted their days.”\nMehra Nabisi, Dunmer, Triune Mistress of the New Temple:\n“Accounts of the Middle Dawn are the province of the Empire of Men, and proof of the deceit that call themselves the Aedra. Eight stars fell on Tamriel, one for each iniquity that Lorkhan made clear to the world. Veloth read these signs, and he told Boethiah, who confirmed them, and he told Mephala, who made wards against them, and he told Azura, who sent ALMSIVI to steer the True Folk clear of harm. Even the Four Corners of the House of Troubles rose to protect the periphery of your madness. We watched our borders and saw them shift like snakes, and saw you run around in it like the spirits of old, devoid of math, without your if-thens, succumbing to the Ever Now like slaves of the slim folly, stasis. Do not ask us where we were when the Dragon Broke, for, of all the world, only we truly know, and we might just show you how to break it again.”\nR'leyt-harhr, Khajiit, Tender to the Mane:\n“Do you mean, where were the Khajiit when the Dragon Broke? R'leyt tells you where: recording it. 'One thousand eight years,' you've heard it. You think the Cyro-Nordics came up with that all on their own. You humans are better thieves than even Rajhin! While you were fighting wars with phantoms and giving birth to your own fathers, it was the Mane that watched the ja-Kha'jay, because the moons were the only constant, and you didn't have the sugar to see it. We'll give you credit: you broke Alkosh something fierce, and that's not easy. Just don't think you solved what you accomplished by it, or can ever solve it. You did it again with Big Walker, not once, but twice! Once at Rimmen, which we'll never learn to live with. The second time it was in Daggerfall, or was it Sentinel, or was it Wayrest, or was it in all three places at once? Get me, Cyrodiil? When will you wake up and realize what really happened to the Dwarves?”\nMannimarco, God of Worms, the Necromancers:\n“The Three Thieves of Morrowind could tell you where they were. So could the High King of Alinor, who was the one who broke it in the first place. There are others on this earth that could, too: Ysmir, Pelinal, Arnand the Fox or should I say Arctus? The Last Dwarf would talk, if they would let him. As for myself, I was here and there and here again, like the rest of the mortals during the Dragon Break. How do you think I learned my mystery? The Maruhkati Selectives showed us all the glories of the Dawn so that we might learn, simply: as above, so below.”"

The seas thrashed and churned, and a wrathful storm appeared. Ysgramor took up the oars and rowed into the storm alone.\nUpon the Sea, Ysgramor wrestled the sea-ghosts, and the storm carried him along the jagged coast. Two fortnights passed without relief, until finally the storm broke. Come the next dawn, Yngol's long-boat was found in the icy surf, but the vengeful sea-ghosts had already taken Yngol and his clansmen.\nIn his terrible grief, Ysgramor slew a dozen dozen beasts and burned them in honor of his fallen kinsman. A barrow-hill was dug in the Atmoran tradition, and Yngol was laid to rest with rites and honors among his clansmen far below the rocky face of Hsaarik Head, the first Children of the Sky to perish in Tamriel."
